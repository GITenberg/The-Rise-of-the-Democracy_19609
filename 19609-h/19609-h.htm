<h3>PREFACE</h3>

  <p>This short account of the rise of political democracy is necessarily
  but an outline of the matter, and while it is not easy to define the
  exact limits, there is no difficulty in noting omissions. For instance,
  there is scarcely any reference to the work of poets or pamphleteers.
  John Ball's rhyming letters are quoted, but not the poems of Langland,
  and the political songs of the Middle Ages are hardly mentioned. The host
  of political pamphleteers in the seventeenth century are excluded, with
  the exception of Lilburne and Winstanley, whose work deserves better
  treatment from posterity than it received from contemporaries. Defoe's
  vigorous services for the Whigs are unnoticed, and the democratic note in
  much of the poetry of Burns, Blake, Byron and Shelley is left
  unconsidered, and the influence of these poets undiscussed. The anti-Corn
  Law rhymes of Ebenezer Eliot, and the Chartist songs of Ernest Jones were
  notable inspirations in their day, and in our own times Walt Whitman and
  Mr. Edward Carpenter have been the chief singers of democracy. But a
  whole volume at least might be written on the part the pen has played in
  the struggle towards democracy.</p>

  <p>Again, there is no mention of Ireland in this short sketch. A
  Nationalist movement is not necessarily a democratic movement, and the
  Irish Nationalist Party includes men of very various political opinions,
  whose single point of agreement is the demand for Home Rule. In India and
  Egypt the agitation is for representative institutions. Ireland might, or
  might not, become a democracy under Home Rule&mdash;who can say?</p>

  <p>The aim of the present writer has been to trace the travelled road of
  the English people towards democracy, and to point out certain landmarks
  on that road, in the hope that readers may be turned to examine more
  closely for themselves the journey taken. For the long march teems with
  adventure and spirited enterprise; and, noting mistakes and failures in
  the past, we may surely and wisely, and yet with greater daring and finer
  courage, pursue the road, not unmindful of the charge committed to us in
  the centuries left behind.</p>

<h2>THE
RISE OF THE DEMOCRACY</h2>

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

<h4><font class="sc">The British Influence</font></h4>

  <p>Our business here is to give some plain account of the movement
  towards democracy in England, only touching incidentally on the progress
  of that movement in other parts of the world. Mainly through British
  influences the movement has become world wide; and the desire for
  national self-government, and the adoption of the political instruments
  of democracy&mdash;popular enfranchisement and the rule of elected
  representatives&mdash;are still the aspirations of civilised man in East
  and West. The knowledge that these forms of democratic government have by
  no means at all times and in all places proved successful does not check
  the movement. As the British Parliament and the British Constitution have
  in the past been accepted as a model in countries seeking free political
  institutions, so to-day our Parliament and our Constitutional Government
  are still quoted with approval and admiration in those lands where these
  institutions are yet to be tried.</p>

  <p>The rise of democracy, then, is a matter in which Britain is largely
  concerned; and this in spite of the fact that in England little respect
  and less attention has been paid to the expounders of democracy and their
  constructive theories of popular government. The notion that philosophers
  are the right persons to manage affairs of state and hold the reins of
  Government has always been repugnant to the English people, and, with us,
  to call a man "a political theorist" is to contemn him. The English have
  not moved towards democracy with any conscious desire for that particular
  form of government, and no vision of a perfect State or an ideal
  commonwealth has sustained them on the march. Our boast has been that we
  are a "practical" people, and so our politics are, as they ever have
  been, experimental. Reforms have been accomplished not out of deference
  to some moral or political principle, but because the abuse to be
  remedied had become intolerable. Dissatisfaction with the Government and
  the conviction that only by enfranchisement and the free election of
  representatives can Parliament remove the grounds of dissatisfaction,
  have carried us towards democracy.</p>

<h4><font class="sc">Government of the People, by the People, for the People</font></h4>

  <p>We have been brought to accept Abraham Lincoln's famous phrase,
  "Government of the people, by the people, for the people," as a
  definition of democracy; but in that acceptance there is no harking back
  to the early democracies of Greece or Rome, so beloved by the French
  democrats of the eighteenth century, who, however, knew very little about
  those ancient states&mdash;or any vain notion of restoring primitive
  Teutonic democracy.</p>

  <p>The sovereign assemblies of Greece&mdash;the Ecclesia of Athens, and
  the Apella of Sparta&mdash;the Comitia Centuriata of Rome, have no more
  resemblance to democracy in the twentieth century than the Witenagemot
  has to the British Parliament; and the democracy which has arisen in
  modern times is neither to be traced for its origin to Greece or Rome,
  nor found to be evolved from Anglo-Saxon times. The early democracies of
  Athens and Sparta were confined to small states, and were based on a
  slave population without civic rights. There was not even a conception
  that slaves might or should take part in politics, and the slaves vastly
  outnumbered the citizens. Modern democracy does not tolerate slavery, it
  will not admit the permanent exclusion of any body of people from
  enfranchisement; though it finds it hard to ignore differences of race
  and colour, it is always enlarging the borders of citizenship. So that
  already in the Australian Commonwealth, in New Zealand, in certain of the
  American States, in Norway, and in Finland, we have the complete
  enfranchisement of all men and women who are of age to vote.</p>

  <p>Apart from this vital difference between a slave-holding democracy and
  a democracy of free citizens&mdash;a difference that rent the United
  States in civil war, and was only settled in America by democracy ending
  slavery&mdash;ancient democracy was government by popular assembly, and
  modern democracy is government through elected representatives. The
  former is only possible in small communities with very limited
  responsibilities&mdash;a parish meeting can decide questions of no more
  than strictly local interest; for our huge empires of to-day nothing
  better than representative government has been devised for carrying out
  the general will of the majority.</p>

  <p>As for the early English Witenagemot, it was simply an assembly of the
  chiefs, and, though crowds sometimes attended, all but the great men were
  the merest spectators. Doubtless the folk-moot of the tribe was
  democratic, for all free men attended it, and the English were a nation
  of freeholders, and the slaves were few&mdash;except in the
  west&mdash;and might become free men.<a name="footnotetag1"
  href="#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> The shire-moot, too, with its
  delegates from the hundred-moots, was equally democratic. But with
  feudalism and the welding of the nation, tribal democracies passed away,
  leaving, however, in many places a valuable tradition of local
  self-government.</p>

<h4><font class="sc">The Foundations of Democracy</font></h4>

  <p>A steady and invincible belief that those who maintain the defence of
  the country and pay for the cost of government should have a voice in the
  great council of the nation, and the conviction that effective utterance
  can be found for that voice in duly chosen representatives, are the
  foundations on which democracy has built. Democracy itself comes in (1)
  when it is seen that all are being taxed for national purposes; and (2)
  the opinion finds acceptance that responsibilities of citizenship should
  be borne by all who have reached the age of manhood and are of sound
  mind.</p>

  <p>To sketch the rise of democracy in England is to trace the steady
  resistance to kings who would govern without the advice of counsellors,
  and to note the growing determination that these counsellors must be
  elected representatives. Only when the absolutism of the Crown is ended
  and a Parliament of elected members has become the real centre of
  government, is it possible, without a revolution, for democracy to be
  established.</p>

  <p>Much of this book is given up, then, to the old stories of kingly rule
  checked and slowly superseded by aristocracy. And all the old attempts at
  revolution by popular insurrection are again retold, not only because of
  the witness they bear to the impossibility in England of achieving
  democracy by the violent overthrow of government, but because they also
  bear witness to the heroic resolution of the English people to take up
  arms and plunge into a sea of troubles rather than bear patiently ills
  that were unseemly for men to endure in silence. Popular insurrection
  failed, but over and over again violence has been resorted to in the
  resistance to tyranny, and has been justified by its victory. If Wat
  Tyler, Jack Cade, and Robert Ket are known as beaten revolutionaries,
  Stephen Langton, Simon of Montfort, and John Hampden are acclaimed as
  patriots for not disdaining the use of armed resistance.</p>

  <p>The conclusion is that a democratic revolution was not to be
  accomplished in England by a rising of the people, but that forcible
  resistance even to the point of civil war was necessary to guard
  liberties already won, or to save the land from gross misgovernment. But
  always the forcible resistance, when successful, has been made not by
  revolutionaries but by the strong champions of constitutional government.
  The fruit of the resistance to John was the Great Charter; of Simon of
  Montfort's war against Henry III., the beginning of a representative
  Parliament; of the war against Charles, the establishment of
  Parliamentary government. Lilburne and his friends hoped that the civil
  war and the abolition of monarchy would bring in democracy, though
  democracy was never in the mind of men like Hampden, who made the war,
  and was utterly uncongenial to Cromwell and the Commonwealth men. But the
  sanctity of monarchy received its death-blow from Cromwell, and perished
  with the deposing of James II.; and there has been no resurrection. To
  the Whig rule we owe the transference of political power from the Crown
  to Parliament. Once it is manifest that Parliament is the instrument of
  authority, that the Prime Minister and his colleagues rule only by the
  permission and with the approval of the House of Commons, and that the
  House of Commons itself is chosen by a certain number of electors to
  represent the nation, then it is plain that the real sovereignty is in
  the electors who choose the House of Commons. As long as the electors are
  few and consist of the great landowners and their satellites, then the
  constitutional government is aristocracy, and democracy is still to
  come.</p>

  <p>And just as discontent with monarchy, and its obvious failure as a
  satisfactory form of government, brought in aristocracy, so at the
  beginning of the nineteenth century discontent with aristocracy was rife,
  and a new industrial middle-class looked for "Parliamentary reform," to
  improve the condition of England.</p>

<h4><font class="sc">British Democracy Experimental, not Doctrinaire</font></h4>

  <p>Resistance to royal absolutism, culminating in the acknowledged
  ascendancy of Parliament and the triumphant aristocracy of 1688, was
  never based on abstract principles of the rights of barons and
  landowners, but sprang from the positive, definite conviction that those
  who furnished arms and men for the king, or who paid certain moneys in
  taxation, were entitled to be heard in the councils of the king; and the
  charters given in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries&mdash;from Henry
  I. to Henry III.&mdash;confirmed this conviction. The resistance to the
  Stuarts was still based on the conviction that direct taxation conferred
  political privileges, but now the claim to speak in the great council of
  the realm had become a request to be listened to by the king, and passed
  rapidly from that to a resolution that the king should have no money from
  Parliament if he refused to listen. The practical inconvenience of a king
  altogether at variance with Parliament was held to be sufficient
  justification for getting rid of James II., and for hobbling all future
  kings with the Bill of Rights.</p>

  <p>The dethronement of aristocracy in favour of democracy has proceeded
  on very similar lines. The mass of English people were far too wretched
  and far too ignorant at the end of the eighteenth century to care
  anything about abstract "rights of man," and only political philosophers
  and a few artisans hoped for improvement in their condition by
  Parliamentary reform. Agricultural England accepted the rule of
  landowners as an arrangement by providence. It was the industrial
  revolution that shattered the feudal notions of society, and created a
  manufacturing population which knew nothing of lowly submission to
  pastors and masters. A middle-class emerged from the very ranks of the
  working people. The factory system brought fortunes to men who a few
  years earlier had been artisans, and to these new capitalists in the
  nineteenth century the aristocracy in power was as irksome as the Stuarts
  had been to the Whigs. If, as the Whigs taught, those who paid the taxes
  were entitled to a voice in the government, then the manufacturing
  districts ought to send representatives to Parliament. It seemed
  monstrous that places like Manchester, Leeds, and Birmingham had no one
  in the House of Commons to plead for the needs of their inhabitants. The
  manufacturer wanted Parliamentary representation because he hoped through
  Parliament to secure the abolition of the political disabilities of
  Nonconformists, and to get financial changes made that would make the
  conditions of trade more profitable. And he felt that it would be better
  for the country if he and the class he represented could speak freely in
  Parliament.</p>

  <p>The workman wanted the vote because he had been brought to believe
  that, possessing the vote, he could make Parliament enact laws that would
  lighten the hardships of his life. The whole of the manufacturing
  class&mdash;capitalist and workman alike&mdash;could see by 1820 that the
  House of Commons was the instrument of the electorate, and that to get
  power they must become electors. (Yet probably not one per cent. of them
  could express clearly any theory of popular sovereignty.) The old Whig
  families, kept out of office by the Tories whom George III. had placed in
  power, and who now controlled the House of Commons, supported reform and
  the enfranchisement of the middle class because they saw no way of
  getting back into power except by a new electorate and a redistribution
  of Parliamentary seats. At the beginning of the twentieth century the
  landowner, still Whig, though now, as a general rule enrolled with the
  Unionist Party, has not been excluded from political power, but the
  representatives of the middle-class and of the working people are
  predominant in the House of Commons. The claim of the House of Lords to
  reject the bills of the Commons has been, in our time, subjected to the
  criticism formerly extended to the royal prerogative, and an
  Act&mdash;the Parliament Act&mdash;has now been passed which formally
  requires the Lords to accept, without serious amendment, every Bill sent
  up from the Commons in three successive sessions.</p>

  <p>The transition from monarchy to aristocracy in England was brought
  about at the price of civil war. In many countries democracy has been
  born in revolution, and the birth pains have been hard and bitter. But in
  England in the nineteenth century democracy was allowed to come into
  being by permission of the aristocracy, and has not yet reached its full
  stature. It is true that violence, bloodshed, loss of life, and
  destruction of property marked the passage of the great Reform Bill; that
  more than once riots and defiance of law and order have been the
  expression of industrial discontent; but on the whole the average
  Englishman is content to wait for the redress of wrongs by Parliamentary
  action. Women have quite recently defied the law, refused to pay taxes,
  and made use of "militant methods" in their agitation for
  enfranchisement. But the women's plea has been that, as they are
  voteless, these methods have been necessary to call attention to their
  demands. Democratic advance has often been hindered and delayed by
  government, and by a national disinclination from rapid political change;
  but as the character of government has changed with the changed character
  of the electorate and the House of Commons, so resistance to democracy
  has always been abandoned when the advance was widely supported, and
  further delay seemed dangerous to the public order.</p>

  <p>The House of Lords is thus seen to yield to the popular
  representatives in the House of Commons, and the government, dependent on
  the House of Commons, to listen to the demand of women for
  enfranchisement.</p>

  <p>While the House of Commons completes its assertion of political
  supremacy, and insists on the absolute responsibility of the chosen
  representatives of the electorate, the agitation for the enfranchisement
  of women is the reminder that democracy has yet to widen its borders.
  Progress to democracy in the last one hundred years is visible not only
  in the enlarged number of enfranchised citizens, but in the general
  admission that every extension of the franchise has been to the public
  good; not only in the fact that men of all classes and trades now have
  their representatives in Parliament, but in the very wide acknowledgment
  that women without votes cannot get that attention by members of the
  House of Commons that is given to male electors. That the majority of
  electors have expressed a decided opinion that the power of the House of
  Lords should be curtailed, as the power of the monarchy has been
  curtailed, and that the decisions of the House of Commons are only to be
  corrected by the House of Commons, is evidence that under our obviously
  imperfect Parliamentary system the will of the electors does get
  registered on the Statute Book.</p>

<h4><font class="sc">Education to Democracy</font></h4>

  <p>Apart from the direct political education to democracy, it is well to
  note the other agencies that have been at work, preparing men and women
  for the responsible task of national self-government.</p>

  <p>In the Middle Ages the religious guilds and the trade guilds, managed
  by their own members, gave men and women a training in democratic
  government. The parish, too, was a commune, and its affairs and finances
  were administered by duly elected officers.<a name="footnotetag2"
  href="#footnote2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

  <p>But the guilds, with their numerous almshouses and hospitals, were all
  suppressed early in Edward VI.'s reign, and their funds confiscated. As
  for the parish, it was shorn of all its property, save the parish church,
  in the same reign, and its old self-governing life dwindled away to the
  election of churchwardens.</p>

  <p>It was not till the beginning of the nineteenth century that the
  working classes, by the formation of trade unions, once more took up the
  task of education in self-government. From that time onward, through
  trade unions, co-operative societies, and friendly societies, with their
  annual conferences and congresses, a steady training in democracy has
  been achieved; and our Labour Party of to-day, with its Members of
  Parliament, its members of county and district councils, and its Justices
  of the Peace, would hardly have been possible but for this training.
  Other agencies may be mentioned. The temperance movement, the
  organisation of working-men's clubs, and the local preaching of the
  Nonconformist Churches&mdash;particularly the Primitive Methodist
  denomination&mdash;have all helped to educate workmen in the conduct of
  affairs, and to create that sense of personal responsibility which is the
  only guarantee of an honest democracy.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTERI">CHAPTER I</a></h3>

<h3>THE EARLY STRUGGLES AGAINST THE ABSOLUTISM
OF THE CROWN</h3>

<h4><font class="sc">The Great Churchmen</font></h4>

  <p>We are far from any thoughts of democracy in the early struggles
  against the absolutism of the Crown. The old love of personal liberty
  that is said to have characterised the Anglo-Saxon had no political
  outlet under Norman feudalism. What we note is that three Archbishops of
  Canterbury were strong enough and brave enough to stand up against the
  unchecked rule of kings, and the names of these great
  Archbishops&mdash;Anselm, Thomas à Becket, and Stephen Langton&mdash;are
  to be honoured for all time for the services they rendered in the making
  of English liberties. Not one of the three was in any sense a democrat.
  It is not till the latter part of the fourteenth century that we find
  John Ball, a wandering, revolutionary priest, uttering for the first time
  in England a democratic doctrine. Anselm, Becket, and Langton did their
  work, as Simon of Montfort, and as Eliot and Hampden worked later, not
  for the sake of a democracy, but for the restriction of an intolerable
  autocracy. All along in English history liberties have been gained and
  enlarged by this process of restriction, and it was only when the powers
  of the Crown had been made subject to Parliament that it was possible, at
  the close of the nineteenth century, for Parliament itself to become
  converted from an assembly of aristocrats to a governing body that really
  represented the nation.</p>

  <p>But in considering the rise of democracy we can no more omit the early
  struggles against the absolutism of the Crown than we can pass over Simon
  of Montfort's Parliament, or the unsuccessful popular revolts, or the war
  with Charles I., or the Whig revolution of 1688. They are all incidents
  of pre-democratic days, but they are all events of significance.
  Democracy is no new order of society, conceived in the fertile mind of
  man; it has been slowly evolved and brought to birth after centuries of
  struggle, to be tried as a form of government only when other forms are
  outgrown, and cease to be acceptable.</p>

  <p>All the great men&mdash;heroic and faulty&mdash;who withstood the
  tyranny of their day, not only wrested charters from kings, they left a
  tradition of resistance; and this tradition has been of incalculable
  service to a nation seeking self-government. It is easy to dismiss the
  work of Anselm and Becket as mere disputes between monarch and Churchman,
  to treat lightly the battle for the Great Charter as a strife between
  king and barons. Just as easy is it to regard the Peasant Revolt of the
  fourteenth century and Jack Cade's rebellion in the fifteenth century as
  the tumults of a riotous mob. The great point is to see clearly in all
  these contests, successful and unsuccessful, the movement for liberty,
  for greater security and expansion of life in England, and to note that
  only by a stern endurance and a willingness not to bear an irksome
  oppression have our liberties been won. In the winning of these liberties
  we have proved our fitness for democracy, for a government that will
  allow the fullest measure of self-development.</p>

  <p>Now, what was it that Anselm contended for, first with William II. and
  then with Henry I.?</p>

<h4><font class="sc">Archbishop Anselm and Norman Autocracy</font></h4>

  <p>Anselm was sixty when, in 1093, William II. named him for the
  Archbishopric of Canterbury. In vain Anselm, who was Abbot of the famous
  monastery of Bec, in Normandy, protested that he was too old, and that
  his business was not with high place and power in this world. The King
  seemed to be dying, and the bishops gathered round the sick bed would not
  hear of any refusal on Anselm's part. They pushed the pastoral staff into
  his hands, and carried him off to a neighbouring church, while the people
  shouted "Long live the bishop!"</p>

  <p>What everybody felt was that with Anselm as Archbishop things might be
  better in England, for Anselm's reputation stood very high. He had been
  the friend of Lanfranc, the late Archbishop; he had been an honoured
  guest at the Court of William the Conqueror; and he was known for his
  deep learning, his sanctity of life, and simple, disinterested devotion
  to duty. It was hoped that with a man of such holiness at Canterbury some
  restraint might be placed on the lawless tyranny of the Red King.
  Lanfranc had been the trusted counsellor and right hand of the Red King's
  father: why should not Anselm bring back the son to the paths of
  decency&mdash;at least? The Archbishop of Canterbury was the chief man in
  the realm next to the king, and for three years since Lanfranc's death
  the see had been kept vacant that William Rufus might enjoy its revenues
  for his own pleasure. It was not unreasonable that men should look to the
  appointment of Anselm as the beginning of an amendment in Church and
  State. The trouble was that William stuck to his evil courses.</p>

  <p>The rule of William the Conqueror had been stern and harsh, and his
  hand had been heavy on the English people. But there had been law and
  justice in the rule; religion and morality had been respected, and peace
  and security obtained.</p>

  <p>The rule of the Red King was not only grievous, it was arbitrary,
  capricious, cruel, and without semblance of law. The austerity of the
  Conqueror had been conspicuous; equally conspicuous was the debauchery of
  his son. The Conqueror had been faithful and conscientious in seeing that
  vacancies in the Church were filled up quickly and wisely. The Red King
  preferred to leave bishoprics and churches empty so that he might annex
  the profits. Lanfranc, a wise and just man, had been the Minister of the
  Conqueror; the Red King made Ranulf (nicknamed the Torch or
  Firebrand)&mdash;a clever, unprincipled clerk&mdash;Bishop of Durham and
  Justiciar. It was Ranulf who did the King's business in keeping churches
  and bishoprics vacant, in violation of law and custom; it was Ranulf who
  plundered the King's vassals and the people at large by every kind of
  extortion, thwarted the protests of Anselm, and encouraged William in his
  savage profligacies.</p>

  <p>Meek and gentle as Anselm was, he had all the courage that comes of a
  lofty sense of responsibility to God, and he stood before kings as the
  Hebrew prophets of old had stood, calm and fearless. At Christmas, 1092,
  three months before his nomination to the See of Canterbury, Anselm was
  in England over the affairs of his monastery, and William invited him to
  Court and treated him with great display of honour. Then some private
  talk took place between the two, and Anselm said plainly that "Things
  were spoken daily of the King, openly or secretly, by nearly all the men
  of his realm, which were not seemly for the King's dignity." From that
  time Anselm stayed in England, for William refused to give him leave to
  return to Normandy.</p>

  <p>Then in March, 1093 came the King's sickness, which most men expected
  to be mortal. Anselm was summoned, and on his arrival bade the King "make
  a clean confession of all that he knows that he has done against God, and
  promise that, should he recover, he will without pretence amend in all
  things. The King at once agreed to this, and with sorrow of heart engaged
  to do all that Anselm required and to keep justice and mercy all his life
  long. To this he pledged his faith, and made his bishops witness between
  himself and God, sending persons in his stead to promise his word to God
  on the altar. An edict was written and sealed with the King's seal that
  all prisoners should be set free in all his dominions, all debts
  forgiven, all offences heretofore committed pardoned and forgotten for
  ever. Further, good and holy laws were promised to the whole people, and
  the sacred upholding of right and such solemn inquest into wrongdoing as
  may deter others."<a name="footnotetag3"
  href="#footnote3"><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

  <p>William did not die, and his repentance was short-lived; but the one
  act of grace he did before leaving his sick bed was to fill up the empty
  throne at Canterbury by the appointment of Anselm&mdash;Anselm's protests
  of unfitness notwithstanding. Then, on the King's recovery, as though to
  make up for the penitence displayed, all the royal promises of amendment
  were broken without shame, and "all the evil which the King had wrought
  before he was sick seemed good by the side of the wrong which he did when
  he was returned to health." The prisoners who had been pardoned were sent
  back to prison, the debts which had been cancelled were re-claimed, and
  all legal actions which had been dropped were resumed. Anselm was now
  enthroned at Canterbury, and his appointment could not be revoked; but
  the King was quick to show his displeasure at the new Archbishop.</p>

  <p>The first point raised by William was that those lands belonging to
  the See of Canterbury, which had been made over to military vassals of
  the Crown while the archbishopric was vacant, should remain with their
  holders. Anselm said at once that this was impossible. He was responsible
  for the administration of all the estates of Canterbury, and to allow
  these lands to be alienated to the Crown was to rob the poor and needy
  who, it was held, had a just claim on the property of the Church.
  Besides, Anselm saw that the lands would never be restored once an
  Archbishop confirmed their appropriation by the King's military tenants.
  There was no one in all England save Anselm who dared withstand the
  Crown, and had he yielded on this matter resistance to the tyranny of the
  Red King would only have been harder on the next occasion.</p>

  <p>Then came the question of a present of money to the King, the
  customary offering. Anselm brought five hundred marks (£333), a very
  considerable sum in those days, and William, persuaded by some of his
  courtiers that twice the amount ought to have been given, curtly declined
  the present. Anselm, who disliked the whole business of these gifts to
  the Crown, for he knew that many a Churchman bought his office by
  promising a "free" gift after institution, solemnly warned William that
  money given freely as his was given was better than a forced tribute, and
  to this William answered that he wanted neither the Archbishop's money
  nor his preaching or company.</p>

  <p>Thereupon Anselm retired and gave the money to the poor, determined
  that he, for his part, would make no attempt to purchase William's
  goodwill. Henceforth William was equally determined that Anselm should
  have no peace in England. It was hateful to the King that there should be
  anyone in the realm who acknowledged a higher authority than the Crown,
  and Anselm made it too plain that the Archbishop rested his authority not
  on the favour of the Crown, but on the discipline of the Christian
  religion. William was King of England indisputably, but there was a
  higher power than the King, and that was the Pope. William himself never
  dreamed of denying the divine authority of the Pope in spiritual matters;
  no one in all Christendom in the eleventh and twelfth centuries
  questioned that at Rome was a court of appeal higher than the courts of
  kings. Strong rulers like William the Conqueror might decline to submit
  to Rome on a personal question of marriage, but Rome was the recognised
  centre of religion, the headquarters of the Christian Church, and the
  supreme court of appeal. Apart from Rome there was no power that could
  curb the fierce unbridled tyranny of the kings of the earth, and the
  power of Rome was a spiritual weapon, for the Pope had no army to enforce
  his decisions. So Anselm, conscious of this spiritual authority, refused
  to bow to the lawless rule of the Red King; and his very attitude, while
  it encouraged men to lift up their hearts who erstwhile had felt that it
  was hopeless and useless to strive against William,<a name="footnotetag4"
  href="#footnote4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> enraged the Red King to fury.</p>

  <p>The things he wanted to forget were that the chief representative of
  the Christian religion was a greater person than the King of England, and
  that the Archbishop of Canterbury could be a Christian minister rather
  than a King's man.<a name="footnotetag5"
  href="#footnote5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> And Anselm was the constant witness
  to the Christian religion, and, by his very presence, a rebuke to the
  crimes and cruelties of the Court of the Red King. William actually wrote
  to the Pope, naturally without any success, praying him to depose Anselm,
  and promising a large annual tribute to Rome if the request was
  granted.</p>

  <p>For years the uneven contest was waged. The bishops generally avoided
  Anselm, and were only anxious to be accepted by the King as good servants
  of the Crown, with the result that William despised them for their
  servility. But the barons began to declare their respect for the brave
  old man at Canterbury.</p>

  <p>At last, when Anselm was summoned to appear before the King's Court,
  to "do the King right," on a trumped-up charge of having failed to send
  an adequate supply of troops for the King's service, he felt the position
  was hopeless. Anselm's longing had been to labour with the King, as
  Lanfranc had laboured, to promote religion in the country, and he had
  been frustrated at every turn. The summons to the King's Court was the
  last straw, for the defendant in this Court was entirely at the mercy of
  the Crown. "When, in Anglo-Norman times you speak of the King's Court, it
  is only a phrase for the King's despotism."<a name="footnotetag6"
  href="#footnote6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> Anselm took no notice of the King's
  summons, and decided to appeal to Rome. For a time William refused
  permission for any departure from England, but he yielded in 1097, and
  Anselm set out for Rome.</p>

  <p>He stayed at Rome and at Lyons till William was dead, for the Pope
  would not let him resign Canterbury, and could do nothing to bring the
  King to a better mind. Then, on the urgent request of Henry I., he
  returned to England, and for a time all went well. Henry was in earnest
  for the restoration of law and religion in England, and his declaration,
  at the very beginning of his reign&mdash;the oft-quoted "charter" of
  Henry I.&mdash;to stop the old scandals of selling and farming out Church
  lands, and to put down all unrighteousness that had been in his brother's
  time, was hailed with rejoicing.</p>

  <p>Anselm stood loyally by Henry over the question of his marriage with
  Edith (who claimed release from vows taken under compulsion in a convent
  at Romsey), and his fidelity at the critical time when Robert of Normandy
  and the discontented nobles threatened the safety of the Crown was
  invaluable. But Henry was an absolutist, anxious for all the threads of
  power to be in his own hands; and just when a great Church Council at the
  Lateran had decided that bishops must not be invested by kings with the
  ring and staff of their office, because by such investiture they were the
  king's vassals, Henry decided to invite Anselm to receive the
  archbishopric afresh from the King's hands by a new act of investiture.
  To Anselm the abject submission of the bishops to the Red King had been a
  painful spectacle; and now Henry was making a demand that would emphasise
  the royal supremacy, and the demand was intolerable and impossible. Again
  Anselm stood practically alone in his resistance to the royal will, and
  again the question in dispute was whether there was any power in England
  higher than the Crown. The papal supremacy was no more under discussion
  than it had been under William. All that Henry wanted was that the
  archbishops and bishops should acknowledge that their authority came from
  the Crown; and at Henry's request Anselm, then 70 years old, again
  journeyed to Rome to lay the matter before the Pope.</p>

  <p>Pope Paschal was fully alive to the mischief of making the bishops and
  clergy mere officers of kings, and it was soon seen there could be no
  dispensations from Rome even for Henry. All that the Pope would allow was
  that bishops might do homage to the Crown for their temporal rights, and
  with this Henry had to be content.</p>

  <p>It was three years later before Anselm returned, and his course was
  now nearly run. He died at peace on April 21st, 1109, having wrought to
  no small purpose for religious liberty and the independence of the
  clergy. (The demand for political and social independence always follows
  the struggle for independence in religion.) Anselm spent the greater part
  of his life after his enthronement at Canterbury in battling for
  independence of the Crown; a century later Archbishop Stephen was to
  carry the battle still further, and win wider liberties for England from
  the Crown.</p>

  <p>Of Anselm's general love of liberty and hatred of all tyranny many
  stories are told. One fact may be recalled. The Church Synod, which met
  at Westminster in 1102, at Anselm's request, attacked the slave trade as
  a "wicked trade used hitherto in England, by which men are sold like
  brute animals," and framed a Church rule against its continuance.</p>

  <p>In spite of this decree, serfdom lingered in England for centuries,
  but hiring superseded open buying and selling of men. (The African slave
  trade was the work of the Elizabethan seamen, and was excused, as slavery
  in the United States was excused, by the Protestant Churches on the
  ground of the racial inferiority of the negro.)</p>

<h4><font class="sc">Thomas à Becket and Henry II.</font></h4>

  <p>Resistance to autocracy is often more needed against a strong and just
  king than it is against an unprincipled profligate. Henry II.'s love of
  order and peace, the strength and energy he spent in curtailing the power
  of the barons, and in making firm the foundations of our national system
  of petty sessions and assize courts have made for him an enduring fame.
  Henry II. was a great lawyer; he was "the flower of the princes of his
  world," in contemporary eyes; but it was as an autocrat he would rule.
  Against this autocracy Thomas à Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury,
  protested, and the protest cost him five years of exile, and finally his
  life. The manner of his death earned for the Archbishop the title of
  martyr, and popular acclamation required him to be canonised as a
  saint,<a name="footnotetag7" href="#footnote7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> and his
  name to be long cherished with deep devotion by the English people. Both
  Henry and Thomas stand out honourably, but the former would have brought
  all England under one great centralised authority, with the Crown not
  only predominant but absolute in its supremacy, and the Archbishop
  contended for the great mass of poor and needy people to mitigate the
  harshness of the law, and to maintain the liberties of the Church against
  the encroachments of sovereignty. "Nothing is more certain," as the old
  writer put it, "than that both strove earnestly to do the will of God,
  one for the sake of his realm, the other on behalf of his Church. But
  whether of the two was zealous in wisdom is not plain to man, who is so
  easily mistaken, but to the Lord, Who will judge between them at the last
  day."</p>

  <p>Becket was the first English-born Archbishop of Canterbury since the
  Norman Conquest. Henry, on his accession, clove to him in friendship,
  made him Lord Chancellor in 1155, and on Archbishop Theobald's death, the
  monks of Canterbury at once accepted Henry's advice and elected him to
  the vacant see. Becket himself knew the King too well to desire the
  appointment, and warned Henry not to press the matter, and prophesied
  that their friendship would be turned to bitter enmity. But Henry's mind
  was made up. As Chancellor, Becket had shown no ecclesiastical bias. He
  had taxed clergy and laity with due impartiality, and his legal decisions
  had been given without fear or favour. Henry counted on Becket to act
  with the same indifference as Archbishop, to be the King's vicegerent
  during the royal absence in France. And here Henry, wise as he was in
  many things, mistook his man. As Chancellor of England Becket conceived
  his business to be the administration of the laws: as Archbishop he was
  first and foremost the champion of the Christian religion, the protector
  of the poor, and the defender of the liberties of the Church. All
  unwilling, like his great predecessor, St. Anselm, to become archbishop,
  from the hour of his consecration to the See of Canterbury, in 1162,
  Becket was as firm as Anselm had been in resisting the absolutism of the
  King. To the King's extreme annoyance the Chancellorship was at once
  given up&mdash;the only instance known of the voluntary resignation of
  the Chancellorship by layman or ecclesiastic,<a name="footnotetag8"
  href="#footnote8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> and all the amusements of the Court
  and the business of the world were laid aside by the new archbishop. The
  care of his diocese, the relief of the poor and the sick, and attendance
  at the sacred offices of the Church were henceforth the work of the man
  who had been Henry's best-loved companion, and within a year of his
  enthronement friendship with the King was broken.</p>

  <p>The first point at issue was whether there should be one common
  jurisdiction in all the land, or whether the Church courts should still
  exist. These Church courts had been set up by William the Conqueror and
  Lanfranc, in order that the clergy should not be mixed up in ordinary law
  matters, and should be excluded strictly from the common courts. No
  penalty involving bloodshed could be inflicted in the Church courts, and
  all the savage barbarities of mutilation, common enough as punishments in
  the King's court, were forbidden. Henry II., apart from his strong desire
  for centralisation in government, wanted these Church courts abolished,
  because every clerk who offended against the law escaped ordinary
  punishment, no matter what the charge might be. Archbishop Thomas saw
  that in the Church courts there was some protection, not only for the
  clergy, but for all minor ecclesiastics, and for widows and orphans,
  against the horrible legal cruelties of the age. "It must be held in mind
  that the Archbishop had on his side the Church or <i>Canon Law</i>, which
  he had sworn to obey, and certainly the law courts erred as much on the
  side of harshness and cruelty as those of the Church on that of foolish
  pity towards evil doers."<a name="footnotetag9"
  href="#footnote9"><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Before this dispute had reached its climax Thomas had boldly taken
  measures against some of the King's courtiers who were defrauding the See
  of Canterbury; and he had successfully withstood Henry's plan for turning
  the old Dane-geld shire tax, which was paid to the sheriff for the
  defence of the country and the up-keep of roads, into a tax to be
  collected by the Crown as part of the royal revenue. Thomas told the King
  plainly that this tax was a voluntary offering to be paid to the sheriffs
  only "so long as they shall serve as fitly and maintain and defend our
  defendants," and said point blank that he would not suffer a penny to be
  taken off his lands for the King's purposes. Henry was obliged to yield,
  and this is the first case known of resistance to the royal will in the
  matter of taxation.</p>

  <p>The case of clerical offenders, and the jurisdiction of the courts
  came before a great council at Westminster in 1163. Henry declared that
  criminous clerks should be deprived of their office in the Church courts,
  and then handed over to the King's courts for punishment. Thomas replied
  that the proposal was contrary to the religious liberties of the land,
  but he met with little support from the rest of the bishops. "Better the
  liberties of the Church perish than that we perish ourselves," they cried
  in fear of the King. Henry followed up his proposal by calling on the
  bishops to abide by the old customs of the realm, as settled by his
  grandfather, Henry I., and to this they all agreed, adding "saving the
  rights of our order."</p>

  <p>A list of the old customs was drawn up, and sixteen
  <i>Constitutions</i>, or articles, were presented to the bishops at the
  Great Council of Clarendon, in January, 1164. To many of these
  Constitutions Thomas objected; notably (1) That clerks were to be tried
  in the King's courts for offences of common law. (2) That neither
  archbishops, bishops, nor beneficed clerks were to leave the kingdom
  without royal permission. (This would not only stop appeals to Rome, it
  would make pilgrimages or attendance at General Councils impossible
  without the King's consent.) (3) That no member of the King's household
  was to be excommunicated without the King's permission. (4) That no
  appeals should be taken beyond the Archbishop's court, except to be
  brought before the King. (This definite prohibition of appeals to Rome
  left the King absolute master in England.) The last article declared that
  neither serfs nor the sons of villeins were to be ordained without the
  consent of the lord on whose land they were born. Against his own
  judgment Thomas yielded to the entreaties of the bishops, and agreed to
  accept the Constitutions of Clarendon, but no sooner had he done so than
  he bitterly repented, and wrote off to the Pope acknowledging his
  mistake. Pope Alexander III. was mainly anxious to prevent open
  hostilities between Henry and the Archbishop, and wrote calmly that he
  was absolved, without suggesting any blame to the King.</p>

  <p>Henry now saw that the Archbishop, and only the Archbishop, stood in
  the way of the royal will, and when another Council met at Northampton,
  in October, 1164, the King was ready to drive Thomas out of office.
  Before this Council Thomas was charged with having refused justice to
  John, the Treasury-Marshall, and with contempt of the King's court, and
  was heavily fined. It was difficult to get sentence pronounced, for the
  barons declined to sit as judges on an archbishop; but at length, Henry,
  Bishop of Winchester, on the King's order, declared the sentence. Henry
  followed up the attack next day by calling upon Thomas to account for
  30,000 marks spent by him while Chancellor. In vain he proved that the
  Justiciar had declared him free of all claims when he laid down the
  Chancellorship, that the charge was totally unexpected; the King refused
  to stay the proceedings unless Thomas would sign the Constitutions of
  Clarendon.</p>

  <p>Consultation with the bishops brought no help. "The King has declared,
  so it is said, that he and you cannot both remain in England as king and
  archbishop. It would be much safer to resign everything and submit to his
  mercy"; thus spake Hilary, of Chichester, and his fellow-bishops all
  urged resignation or submission.</p>

  <p>Two days later the Archbishop came into the Council in full robes with
  the Cross in his hand. Earl Robert, of Leicester, rose to pass sentence
  upon him and at once the Archbishop refused to hear him. "Neither law nor
  reason permit children to pass sentence on their father," he declared. "I
  will not hear this sentence of the King, or any judgment of yours. For,
  under God, I will be judged by the Pope alone, to whom before you all
  here I appeal, placing the Church of Canterbury under God's protection
  and the protection of the Pope."</p>

  <p>There were shouts of anger at these words, and some tore rushes from
  the floor and flung at him, but no one dared to stop the Archbishop's
  passage as he passed from the hall. It was useless to look for help or
  justice in England, and that very night Thomas left England for Flanders
  to appeal to Rome.</p>

  <p>But Pope Alexander could do no more for Thomas than his predecessor
  had done for Anselm; only he would not allow any resignation from
  Canterbury. Henry himself appealed to the Pope in 1166, fearing
  excommunication by the Archbishop; "thus by a strange fate it happened
  that the King, while striving for those 'ancient customs' by which he
  endeavoured to prevent any right of appeal (to the Pope), was doomed to
  confirm the right of appeal for his own safety." The Pope did what he
  could to arrange a reconciliation, but it was not till 1170 that the
  King, seriously alarmed that Thomas would place England under an
  interdict, agreed to a reconciliation.</p>

  <p>On December 1st the exile was over, and Thomas landed at Sandwich, and
  went at once to Canterbury. There were many who doubted whether there
  could be lasting peace between the King and the Archbishop, and while the
  bishops generally hated the Primate's return, the nobles spoke openly of
  him as a traitor to the King.</p>

  <p>The end was near. Thomas, asked to withdraw the sentence of
  excommunication he had passed against the Archbishop of York and the
  Bishop of London and Salisbury for violating the privileges of
  Canterbury, answered that the matter must go before the Pope. The
  bishops, instead of going to Rome, hastened to Henry, who was keeping his
  Court at Bur, in France.</p>

  <p>Henry, at the complaint of the bishops, broke out into one of those
  terrible fits of anger which overcame him from time to time, and four
  knights left the Court saying, "All this trouble will be at an end when
  Thomas is dead, and not before." On December 29th these knights were at
  Canterbury, and at nightfall, just when vespers had begun, they slew
  Archbishop Thomas by the great pillar in the Cathedral. So died this
  great Archbishop for the liberties of the Church, and, as it seemed to
  him, for the welfare of the people.</p>

  <p>Henry was horrified at the news of the Archbishop's death, and
  hastened to beg absolution from Rome for the rash words that had provoked
  the murder. In the presence of the Papal legate he promised to give up
  the Constitutions of Clarendon, nor in the remaining eighteen years of
  his reign did Henry make any fresh attempt to bring the Church under the
  subjection of the Crown.</p>

  <p>To the great bulk of English people Thomas was a saint and martyr, and
  numerous churches were dedicated in his name. More than three hundred
  years later Henry VIII. decided that St. Thomas was an enemy of princes,
  that his shrine at Canterbury must be destroyed, and his festival
  unhallowed. But the fame of Thomas à Becket has survived the censure of
  Henry VIII., and his name shines clearly across the centuries. Democracy
  has been made possible by the willingness of brave men in earlier
  centuries to resist, to the death, an absolutism that would have left
  England bound and chained to the king's throne.</p>

<h4><font class="sc">Stephen Langton and John</font></h4>

  <p>Stephen Langton was consecrated Archbishop of Canterbury in June,
  1207, on the nomination of Pope Innocent III.; the monks of Canterbury,
  who had proposed their own superior, consenting to the appointment, for
  Langton had a high reputation for learning and was known to be of exalted
  character. But King John, who had wanted a man of his own heart for the
  archbishopric&mdash;John of Gray, Bishop of Norwich, commonly spoken of
  as "a servant of Mammon, and an evil shepherd that devoured his own
  sheep"&mdash;was enraged, and refusing to acknowledge Langton, defied the
  Pope, drove the monks out of the country, and declared that anyone who
  acknowledged Stephen Langton as archbishop should be accounted a public
  enemy. So it came about that the great English statesman who broke down
  the foulest and worst tyranny the land had known, and won for England the
  Great Charter of its liberties, was a nominee of the Pope, and was to
  find himself under the displeasure of the Papal legate when the Charter
  had been signed! For six years John kept Stephen out of Canterbury, while
  England lay under an interdict, with its King excommunicate and outside
  the pale of the Church. Most of the bishops fled abroad, "fearing the
  King, but afraid to obey him for dread of the Pope," and John laid hands
  on Church property and filled the royal treasury with the spoils of
  churchmen and Jews. But in 1213 John's position had become precarious,
  for the northern barons were plotting his overthrow, and the Pope had
  absolved all his subjects from allegiance, and given sentence that "John
  should be thrust from his throne and another worthier than he should
  reign in his stead," naming Philip of France as his successor. John was
  aware that he could not count on the support of the barons in a war with
  France, and a prophecy of Peter, the Wakefield Hermit, that the crown
  would be lost before Ascension Day, made him afraid of dying
  excommunicate. Accordingly John decided to get the Pope on his side. He
  agreed to receive Pandulf, the Papal legate; to acknowledge Stephen; make
  good the damage done to the Church, and, in addition, voluntarily ("of
  our own good free will and by the common counsel of our barons")
  surrendered "to God and to the Holy Mother Church of Rome, and to Pope
  Innocent and his Catholic successors," the whole realm of England and
  Ireland, "with all rights thereunto appertaining, to receive them back
  and hold them thenceforth as a feudatory of God and the Roman Church." He
  swore fealty to the Pope for both realms, and promised a yearly tribute
  of 1,000 marks.</p>

  <p>This abject submission to the Pope was a matter of policy. John cared
  nothing for any appearance of personal or national humiliation, and as he
  had broken faith with all in England, so, if it should suit his purpose,
  would he as readily break faith with Rome. But the immediate advantage of
  having the Pope for his protector seemed considerable. "For when once he
  had put himself under apostolical protection and made his realms a part
  of the patrimony of St. Peter, there was not in the Roman world a
  sovereign who durst attack him or would invade his lands, in such awe was
  Pope Innocent held above all his predecessors for many years past."<a
  name="footnotetag10" href="#footnote10"><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Stephen landed in June, 1213, and at Winchester John was formally
  absolved and the coronation oaths were renewed. It was very soon seen
  what manner of man the Archbishop was. In August a great gathering of the
  barons took place in St. Paul's, and there Langton recited the coronation
  charter of Henry I., and told all those assembled that these rights and
  liberties were to be recovered; and "the barons swore they would fight
  for these liberties, even unto death if it were needful, and the
  Archbishop promised that he would help with all his might." The weakness
  of the barons hitherto had been their want of cohesion, their endless
  personal feuds, and the lack of any feeling of national responsibility.
  Langton laboured to create a national party and to win recognition of law
  and justice for all in England; and the Great Charter was the issue of
  his work.</p>

  <p>The state of things was intolerable. The whole administration of
  justice was corrupt. The decisions of the King's courts were as arbitrary
  as the methods employed to enforce sentence. Free men were arrested,
  evicted, exiled, and outlawed without even legal warrant or the semblance
  of a fair trial. All the machinery of government set up by the Norman
  kings, and developed under Henry II., had, in John's hands, become a mere
  instrument of despotic extortion, to be used against anybody and
  everybody, from earl to villein, who could be fleeced by the King's
  servants.</p>

  <p>John saw the tide rising against him, and endeavoured to divide barons
  from Churchmen by proclaiming that the latter should have free and
  undisturbed right of election when bishoprics and other ecclesiastical
  offices were vacant. But the attempt failed. Langton was too resolute a
  statesman, and his conception of the primacy of Canterbury was too high
  for any turning back from the work he had set himself to accomplish. The
  rights of election in the Church were important, but the restoration of
  justice and order and the ending of tyranny were, in his eyes, hardly
  less important. John, who had been at war in France, returned defeated
  from his last attempt to recover for the Crown the lost Angevin
  provinces, to face a discontent that was both wide and general. The
  people, and in especial the barons and knights whom for fourteen years
  John had robbed, insulted, and spurned, and whose liberties he had
  trampled upon, were ready at last under wise leadership to end the
  oppression.</p>

  <p>In November, 1214, the Archbishop saw that the time was come for
  action, and again the barons met in council. Before the high altar in the
  Abbey Church of St. Edmundsbury they swore that if the King sought to
  evade their demand for the laws and liberties of Henry I.'s charter, they
  would make war upon him until he pledged himself to confirm their rights
  in a charter under royal seal. "They also agreed that after Christmas
  they would go all together to the King and ask him for a confirmation of
  these liberties, and that meanwhile they would so provide themselves with
  horses and arms that if the King should seek to break his oath, they
  might, by seizing his castles, compel him to make satisfaction. And when
  these things were done every man returned to his own home."<a
  name="footnotetag11" href="#footnote11"><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

  <p>John now asked for time to consider these requests, and for the next
  six months worked hard to break up the barons' confederacy, to gain
  friends and supporters, and to get mercenaries from Poitou. It was all to
  no purpose. As a last resource he took the Cross, expecting to be saved
  as a crusader from attack, and at the same time he wrote to the Pope to
  help his faithful vassal. The Pope's letters rebuking the barons for
  conspiracy against the King were unheeded, and the mercenaries were
  inadequate when John was confronted by the whole baronage in arms.</p>

<h4><font class="sc">The Great Charter</font></h4>

  <p>In May a list of articles to be signed was sent to John; and on his
  refusal the barons formally renounced their homage and fealty and flew to
  arms. John was forced to surrender before this host. On June 15th he met
  the barons at Runnymede, between Staines and Windsor, and there, in the
  presence of Archbishop Stephen and "a multitude of most illustrious
  knights," sealed the Great Charter of the Liberties of England.</p>

  <p>This Great Charter was in the main a renewal of the old rights and
  liberties promised by Henry I. It set up no new rights, conferred no new
  privileges, and sanctioned no changes in the Constitution. Its real and
  lasting importance is due to its being a written document&mdash;for the
  first time in England it was down in black and white, for all to read,
  what the several rights and duties of King and people were, and in what
  the chief points of the Constitution consisted.</p>

    <h4>MAGNA CHARTA</h4>

    <h4>A facsimile of the Original in the British Museum.</h4>
  </div>
  <p>The Great Charter is a great table of laws. It marks the beginning of
  written legislation, and anticipates Acts of Parliament. Unwritten laws
  and traditions were not abolished: they remain with us to this day; but
  the written law had become a necessity when "the bonds of unwritten
  custom" failed to restrain kings and barons. The Great Charter also took
  into account the rights of free men, and of the tenants of the King's
  vassals. If the barons and knights had their grievances to be redressed,
  the commons and the freeholding peasants needed protection against the
  lawless exactions of their overlords.<a name="footnotetag12"
  href="#footnote12"><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Sixty-three clauses make up Magna Charta, and we may summarise them as
  follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p>(1) The full rights and liberties of the Church are acknowledged;
  bishops shall be freely elected, so that the Church of England shall be
  free.<a name="footnotetag13" href="#footnote13"><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

  <p>(2-8) The King's tenants are to have their feudal rights secured
  against abuse. Widows&mdash;in the wardship of the Crown&mdash;are to be
  protected against robbery and against compulsion to a second
  marriage.</p>

  <p>(9-11) The harsh rules for securing the payment of debts to the Crown
  and to the Jews (in whose debts the Crown had an interest) are to be
  relaxed.</p>

  <p>(12-14) No scutage or aid (save for the three regular feudal
  aids&mdash;the ransom of the King, the knighting of his eldest son, and
  the marriage of his eldest daughter) is to be imposed except by the
  Common Council of the nation; and to this Council archbishops, bishops,
  abbots, earls, and greater barons are to be called by special writ, while
  all who held their land directly from the King, and were of lesser rank,
  were to be summoned by a general writ addressed to the sheriff of the
  county. Forty days' notice of the meeting was to be given, and also the
  cause of the assembly. The action of those who obeyed the summons was to
  be taken to represent the action of all.<a name="footnotetag14"
  href="#footnote14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> (This last clause is never
  repeated in later confirmations of the Great Charter.)</p>

  <p>(15-16) The powers of lords over their tenants are limited and
  defined.</p>

  <p>(17-19) A Court of Common Pleas is to be held in some fixed place so
  that suitors are not obliged to follow the King's Curia. Cases touching
  the ownership of land are to be tried in the counties by visiting
  justices, and by four knights chosen by the county.</p>

  <p>(20-23) No freeman is to be fined beyond his offence, and the penalty
  is to be fixed by a local jury. Earls and barons to be fined by their
  peers; and clerks only according to the amount of their lay property.</p>

  <p>(24-33) The powers of sheriffs, constables, coroners, and bailiffs of
  the King are strictly defined. No sheriff is to be a justice in his own
  county. Royal officers are to pay for all the goods taken by requisition;
  money is not to be taken in lieu of service from those who are willing to
  perform the service. The horses and carts of freemen are not to be seized
  for royal work without consent. The weirs in the Thames, Medway, and
  other rivers in England are to be removed.</p>

  <p>(34-38) Uniformity of weights and measures is directed. Inquests are
  to be granted freely. The sole wardship of minors who have other lords
  will not be claimed by the King, except in special cases. No bailiff may
  force a man to ordeal without witnesses.</p>

  <p>(39-40) No free man is to be taken, imprisoned, ousted of his land,
  outlawed, banished, or hurt in any way save by the judgment of his peers,
  or the law of the land. The King is not to sell, delay, or deny right or
  justice to anyone.</p>

  <p>(41-42) Merchants may go out or come in without paying exorbitant
  customs. All "lawful" men are to have a free right to pass in and out of
  England in time of peace.</p>

  <p>(44-47) An inquiry into the Forest Laws and a reform of the forest
  abuses are promised. All forests made in present reign to be disforested,
  and all fences in rivers thrown down.</p>

  <p>(49-60) The foreign mercenaries of the King, all the detested gang
  that came with horses and arms to the hurt of the realm, are to be sent
  out of the country. The Welsh princes and the King of Scots (who had
  sided with the barons) are to have justice done. A general amnesty for
  all political offences arising from the struggle is made.</p>

  <p>The last three articles appointed twenty-five barons, chosen out of
  the whole baronage, to watch over the keeping of the Charter. They were
  empowered to demand that any breach of the articles should at once be put
  right, and, in default to make war on the King till the matter was
  settled to their satisfaction. Finally there was the oath to be taken on
  the part of the King, and on the part of the barons that the articles of
  the Charter should be observed in good faith according to their plain
  meaning.</p>

  <p>The Great Charter was signed, and then in a wild burst of rage John
  shouted to his foreign supporters, "They have given me five-and-twenty
  over-kings!"</p>

  <p>Within a week of Runnymede the Great Charter was published throughout
  England, but neither King nor barons looked for peace. John was ready to
  break all oaths, and while he set about increasing his army of
  mercenaries, he also appealed to the Pope, as his overlord, protesting
  that the Charter had been wrested from him by force.</p>

  <p>Langton and the bishops left for Rome to attend a general council.
  Pope Innocent declared the Charter annulled on the ground that both King
  and barons had made the Pope overlord of England, and that consequently
  nothing in the government could be changed without his consent. But with
  Langton, the bishops, and the Papal legate all away at Rome, there was no
  one to publish the Papal repudiation of the Charter, and the King and
  barons were already at civil war. Pope Innocent III. was dead in the
  spring of 1216, and John's wretched reign was over when the King lay
  dying at Newark in October.</p>

  <p>Stephen Langton was back again at Canterbury in 1217, and for eleven
  more years worked with William the Marshall and Hubert of Burgh to
  maintain public peace and order during Henry III.'s boyhood. At Oxford,
  in 1223, the Charter was confirmed afresh, and two years later it was
  solemnly proclaimed again when the King wanted a new subsidy. As long as
  the great statesmen were in office Henry III. was saved from the weakness
  that cursed his rule in England for nearly forty years. But William the
  Marshall died in 1219, Archbishop Stephen in 1228, and Hubert was
  dismissed from the justiciarship in 1234. A horde of greedy aliens from
  Poitou fed at the Court of Henry and devoured the substance of England,
  until men arose, as Langton had arisen, to demand the enforcement of
  charters and a just administration of the laws.</p>

  <p>Again a national party arises under the leadership of Simon of
  Montfort, and in their victory over the King we get the beginnings of
  Parliamentary government and popular representation. Every step forward
  is followed by reaction, but the ground lost is recovered, and the next
  step taken marks always a steady advance. Over and over again it has
  seemed that all the liberties won in the past were lost, but looking back
  we can see that there has been no lasting defeat of liberty. Only for a
  time have the forces of oppression triumphed; it is soon found impossible
  in England to rest under tyranny, or to govern without the consent of the
  governed. And every fresh campaign for the restriction of kingly power
  brings us nearer the day of democratic government.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTERII">CHAPTER II</a></h3>

<h3>THE BEGINNING OF PARLIAMENTARY REPRESENTATION</h3>

<h4><font class="sc">Democracy and Representative Government</font></h4>

  <p>To-day democracy takes the form of representative government in
  civilised countries; and for representative government contend the
  nations and peoples seeking democracy.</p>

  <p>The weak spots in all popular electoral systems are obvious, and the
  election of representatives is always a subject for jokes and satire. It
  could hardly be otherwise. For the best machinery in the world needs some
  sort of sympathetic intelligence in the person who manipulates it, and
  the machinery of popular elections can only be worked successfully with a
  large measure of sincerity and good will. In the hands of the ambitious,
  the self-seeking, and the unscrupulous, democratic politics are a machine
  for frustrating popular representation, and as this state of things is
  always prevalent somewhere, the humorist and the satirist naturally treat
  politics without respect.</p>

  <p>But in spite of all its faults and failings&mdash;glaring as these
  are&mdash;mankind can at present devise nothing better than
  representative government, and the abuse of power, the cunning, roguery,
  and corruption that too often accompany popular elections and democratic
  administration, rather stir honest men to action than make them incline
  to dictatorship and absolutism.</p>

  <p>The present notion about representative government is that it makes
  possible the expression of popular will, and can ensure the fulfilment of
  that will. In the thirteenth century, when we get the beginnings of
  representative government, there is no question of the people making
  positive proposals in legislation, but there is a distinct belief that
  the consent of the governed ought to be obtained by the ruling power. The
  mere legal maxim from the Code of Justinian, that "that which touches all
  shall be approved by all,"<a name="footnotetag15"
  href="#footnote15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> "becomes transmuted by Edward I.
  into a great political and constitutional principle."<a
  name="footnotetag16" href="#footnote16"><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

<h4><font class="sc">Representative Theory First Found in Ecclesiastical Assemblies</font></h4>

  <p>More than a century earlier the first recorded appearances of town
  representatives are found in the Spanish Cortes of Aragon and Castile.<a
  name="footnotetag17" href="#footnote17"><sup>[17]</sup></a> St. Dominic
  makes a representative form of government the rule in his Order of
  Preaching Friars, each priory sending two representatives to its
  provincial chapter, and each province sending two representatives to the
  general chapter of the Order.</p>

  <p>In England, Simon of Montfort, the son of Simon, the great warrior of
  the Albigensian wars and the warm friend of Dominic, was in close
  association with the friars. Hence there was nothing so very remarkable
  in Earl Simon issuing writs for the Full Parliament of 1265 for the
  return of two burgesses from each city and borough. He had seen
  representative government at work among the friars in their chapters. Why
  should the plan be not equally useful in the government of the country?<a
  name="footnotetag18" href="#footnote18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> There is no
  evidence that the summons to the burgesses was regarded as a
  revolutionary proposal&mdash;so lightly comes political change in
  England.</p>

  <p>The name of Simon of Montfort, Earl of Leicester, must always be
  associated with the beginning of representative government in England.
  Let us recall how it was the great Earl came to be in power in 1265.</p>

<h4><font class="sc">The Misrule of Henry III.</font></h4>

  <p>Henry III. was always in want of money, and his crew of royal
  parasites from Poitou drained the exchequer. Over and over again the
  barons called on the King to get rid of his favourites, and to end the
  misrule that afflicted the country; and the King from time to time gave
  promises of amendment. But the promises were always broken. As long as
  Henry could get money he was averse from all constitutional reform. In
  1258 the barons were determined that a change must be made. "If the King
  can't do without us in war, he must listen to us in peace," they
  declared. "And what sort of peace is this when the King is led astray by
  bad counsellors, and the land is filled with foreign tyrants who grind
  down native-born Englishmen?"</p>

  <p>William of Rishanger, a contemporary writer, expressed the popular
  feeling in well-known verses:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"The King that tries without advice to seek his country's weal</p>
      <p>Must often fail; he cannot know the wants and woes they feel.</p>
      <p>The Parliament must tell the King how he may serve them best,</p>
      <p>And he must see their wants fulfilled and injuries redressed.</p>
      <p>A King should seek his people's good and not his own sweet will.</p>
      <p>Nor think himself a slave because men hold him back from ill."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>"The King's mistakes call for special treatment," said Richard, Earl
  of Gloucester.</p>

<h4><font class="sc">Simon of Montfort, Leader of the National Party</font></h4>

  <p>So that year a Parliament met in Oxford, in the Dominican Priory. It
  was called the "Mad Parliament," because the barons all came to it fully
  armed, and civil war seemed imminent. But Earl Simon and Richard of
  Gloucester carried the barons with them in demanding reform. Henry was
  left without supporters, and civil war was put off for five years.</p>

  <p>The work done at this Parliament of Oxford was an attempt to make the
  King abide loyally by the Great Charter; and the Provisions of Oxford, as
  they were called, set up a standing council of fifteen, by whom the King
  was to be guided, and ordered that Parliament was to meet three times a
  year: at Candlemas (February 2nd), on June 1st, and at Michaelmas. Four
  knights were to be chosen by the King's lesser freeholders in each county
  to attend this Parliament, and the baronage was to be represented by
  twelve commissioners.</p>

  <p>It was an oligarchy that the Provisions of Oxford established,
  "intended rather to fetter the King than to extend or develop the action
  of the community at large. The baronial council clearly regards itself as
  competent to act on behalf of all the estates of the realm, and the
  expedient of reducing the national deliberations to three sessions of
  select committees betrays a desire to abridge the frequent and somewhat
  irksome duty of attendance in Parliament rather than to share the central
  legislative and deliberative power with the whole body of the people. It
  must, however, be remembered that the scheme makes a very indistinct
  claim to the character of a final arrangement."<a name="footnotetag19"
  href="#footnote19"><sup>[19]</sup></a></p>

  <p>For a time things went better in England. The aliens at Henry's Court
  fled over-seas, and their posts were filled by Englishmen. Parliament
  also promised that the vassals of the nobles should have better
  treatment, and that the sheriffs should be chosen by the shire-moots, the
  county freeholders.</p>

  <p>But Henry's promises were quickly broken, and war broke out on the
  Welsh borders between Simon of Montfort's friend Llewellyn and Mortimer
  and the Marchers. Edward, Prince of Wales, stood by the Provisions of
  Oxford for a few years, but supported his father when the latter refused
  to re-confirm the Provisions in 1263. As a last resource to prevent civil
  war, Simon and Henry agreed to appeal to King Louis of France to
  arbitrate on the fulfilment of the Provisions. The Pope had already
  absolved Henry from obedience to the Provisions, and the Award of Louis,
  given at Amiens and called the <i>Mise of Amiens</i>, was entirely in
  Henry's favour. It annulled the Provisions of Oxford, left the King free
  to appoint his own ministers, council, and sheriffs, to employ aliens,
  and to enjoy power uncontrolled. But the former charters of the realm
  were declared inviolate, and no reprisals were to take place.</p>

  <p>To Simon and most of the barons the Award was intolerable, and when
  Henry returned from France with a large force ready to take the vengeance
  which the Award had forbidden, civil war could not be prevented. London
  rallied to Simon, and Oxford, the Cinque Ports, and the friars were all
  on the side of the barons against the King.</p>

  <p>On May 14th, 1264, a pitched battle at Lewes ended in complete victory
  for Simon, and found the King, Prince Edward, and the kinsmen and chief
  supporters of the Crown prisoners in his hands.</p>

  <p>Peace was made, and a treaty&mdash;the <i>Mise of
  Lewes</i>&mdash;drawn up and signed. Once more the King promised to keep
  the Provisions and Charters, and to dismiss the aliens. He also agreed to
  live thriftily till his debts were paid, and to leave his sons as
  hostages with Earl Simon.</p>

  <p>Simon at once set about the work of reform. The King's Standing, or
  Privy, Council was reconstituted, and the Parliamentary Commissioners
  were abolished, "for Simon held it as much a man's duty to think and work
  for his country as to fight for it." A marked difference is seen between
  Simon's policy at Oxford and the policy after Lewes. The Provisions of
  1258 were restrictive. The Constitution of 1264 deliberately extended the
  limits of Parliament. "Either Simon's views of a Constitution had rapidly
  developed, or the influences which had checked them in 1258 were removed.
  Anyhow, he had genius to interpret the mind of the nation, and to
  anticipate the line which was taken by later progress."<a
  name="footnotetag20" href="#footnote20"><sup>[20]</sup></a> What Simon
  wanted was the approval of all classes of the community for his plans,
  and to that end he issued writs for the Parliament&mdash;the <i>Full
  Parliament</i>&mdash;of 1265.</p>

  <p>The great feature of this Parliament was that for the first time the
  burgesses of each city and borough were summoned to send two
  representatives. In addition, two knights were to come from each shire,
  and clergy and barons as usual&mdash;though in the case of the earls and
  barons only twenty-three were invited, for Simon had no desire for the
  presence of those who were his enemies. The Full Parliament sat till
  March, and then two months later war had once more blazed out. Earl
  Gilbert of Gloucester broke away from Simon, Prince Edward escaped from
  custody, and these two joined Lord Mortimer and the Welsh Marchers.</p>

  <p>On August 4th Edward surprised and routed the army of the younger
  Simon near Kenilworth, and then advanced to crush the great Earl, who was
  encamped at Evesham, waiting to join forces with his son. All hope of
  escape for Earl Simon was lost, and he was outnumbered by seven to two.
  But fly he would not. One by one the barons who stood by Simon were cut
  down, but though wounded and dismounted, the great Earl "fought on to the
  last like a giant for the freedom of England, till a foot soldier stabbed
  him in the back under the mail, and he was borne down and slain." For
  three hours the unequal fight lasted in the midst of storm and darkness,
  and when it was over the Grey Friars carried the mangled body of the dead
  Earl into the priory at Evesham, and laid it before the high altar, for
  the poorer clergy and the common people all counted Simon of Montfort for
  a saint.</p>

  <p>"Those who knew Simon praise his piety, admire his learning, and extol
  his prowess as a knight and skill as a general. They tell of his simple
  fare and plain russet dress, bear witness to his kindly speech and firm
  friendship to all good men, describe his angry scorn for liars and unjust
  men, and marvel at his zeal for truth and right, which was such that
  neither pleasure nor threats nor promises could turn him aside from
  keeping the oath he swore at Oxford; for he held up the good cause 'like
  a pillar that cannot be moved, and, like a second Josiah, esteemed
  righteousness the very healing of his soul.' As a statesman he wished to
  bind the King to rule according to law, and to make the King's Ministers
  responsible to a Full Parliament; and though he did not live to see the
  success of his policy, he had pointed out the way by which future
  statesmen might bring it about."<a name="footnotetag21"
  href="#footnote21"><sup>[21]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In the hour of Simon's death it might seem that the cause of good
  government was utterly lost, and for a time Henry triumphed with a fierce
  reaction. But the very barons who had turned against Simon were quite
  determined that the Charters should be observed, and Edward was to show,
  on his coming to the throne, that he had grasped even more fully than
  Simon the notion of a national representative assembly, and that he
  accepted the principle, "that which touches all shall be approved by
  all."</p>

  <p>Henry III. died in 1272, and it was not till two years later that
  Edward I. was back in England from the crusades to take up the crown. It
  was an age of great lawgivers; an age that saw St. Louis ruling in
  France, Alfonso the Wise in Castile, the Emperor Frederick II.&mdash;the
  Wonder of the World&mdash;in Sicily. In England Edward shaped the
  Constitution and settled for future times the lines of Parliamentary
  representative government.</p>

<h4><font class="sc">Edward I.'s Model Parliament, 1295</font></h4>

  <p>For the first twenty years Edward's Parliaments were great assemblies
  of barons and knights, and it was not till 1295 that the famous Model
  Parliament was summoned. "It is very evident that common dangers must be
  met by measures concerted in common," ran the writ to the bishops. Every
  sheriff was to cause two knights to be elected from each shire, two
  citizens from each city, two burgesses from each borough. The clergy were
  to be fully represented from each cathedral and each diocese.</p>

  <p>Hitherto Parliament, save in 1265, had been little else than a feudal
  court, a council of the King's tenants; it became, after 1295, a national
  assembly. Edward's plan was that the three estates&mdash;clergy, barons,
  and commons: those who pray, those who fight, and those who
  work&mdash;should be represented. But the clergy always stood aloof,
  preferring to meet in their own houses of convocation; and the
  archbishops, bishops, and greater abbots only attended because they were
  great holders of land and important feudal lords.</p>

  <p>Although the knights of the shire were of much the same class as the
  barons, the latter received personal summons to attend, and the knights
  joined with the representatives of the cities and boroughs. So the two
  Houses of Parliament consisted of barons and bishops&mdash;lords
  spiritual and lords temporal&mdash;and knights and commons; and we have
  to-day the House of Lords and the House of Commons; the former, as in the
  thirteenth century, lords spiritual and temporal, the latter,
  representatives from counties and boroughs.</p>

  <p>The admission of elected representatives was to move, in course of
  time, the centre of government from the Crown to the House of Commons;
  but in Edward I.'s reign Parliament was just a larger growth of the
  King's Council&mdash;the Council that Norman and Plantagenet kings relied
  on for assistance in the administration of justice and the collection of
  revenue. The judges of the supreme court were always summoned to
  Parliament, as the law lords sit in the Upper House to-day.</p>

  <p>Money, or rather the raising of money, was the main cause for calling
  a Parliament. The clergy at first voted their own grants to the Crown in
  convocation, but came to agree to pay the taxes voted by Lords and
  Commons, And Lords and Commons, instead of making separate grants, joined
  in a common grant.</p>

  <p>"And, as the bulk of the burden fell upon the Commons, they adopted a
  formula which placed the Commons in the foreground. The grant was made by
  the Commons, with the assent of the Lords spiritual and temporal. This
  formula appeared in 1395, and became the rule. In 1407, eight years after
  Henry IV. came to the throne, he assented to the important principle that
  money grants were to be initiated by the House of Commons, were not to be
  reported to the King until both Houses were agreed, and were to be
  reported by the Speaker of the Commons' House. This rule is strictly
  observed at the present day. When a money bill, such as the Finance bill
  for the year or the Appropriation bill, has been passed by the House of
  Commons and agreed to by the House of Lords, it is, unlike all other
  bills, returned to the House of Commons."<a name="footnotetag22"
  href="#footnote22"><sup>[22]</sup></a> The Speaker, with his own hand,
  delivers all money bills to the Clerk of Parliaments, the officer whose
  business it is to signify the royal assent.</p>

  <p>In addition to voting money, the Commons, on the assembly of
  Parliament, would petition for the redress of grievances. In the
  thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, they were not legislators, but
  petitioners for legislation; and as it often happened that their
  petitions were not granted in the form they asked, it became a matter of
  bitter complaint that the laws did not correspond with the petitions.
  Henry V. in 1414 granted the request that "nothing should be enacted to
  the petition of the Commons contrary to their asking, whereby they should
  be bound without their assent"; and from that time it became customary
  for bills to be sent up to the Crown instead of petitions, leaving the
  King the alternative of assent or reaction.</p>

<h4><font class="sc">The Nobility Predominant in Parliament</font></h4>

  <p>In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, the power of Parliament was
  strong enough to force the abdication of two kings&mdash;Edward II. and
  Richard II.&mdash;but not strong enough to free the land of the turbulent
  authority of the nobles. This authority went down in the struggles of the
  Lancastrians and Yorkists.</p>

  <p>"The bloody faction fights known as the Wars of the Roses brought the
  Plantagenet dynasty to a close, weeded out the older nobility, and
  cleared the way for a new form of monarchy."<a name="footnotetag23"
  href="#footnote23"><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

  <p>"The high nobility killed itself out. The great barons who adhered to
  the 'Red Rose' or the 'White Rose,' or who fluctuated from one to the
  other, became poorer, fewer, and less potent every year. When the great
  struggle ended at Bosworth, a large part of the greatest combatants were
  gone. The restless, aspiring, rich barons, who made the civil war, were
  broken by it. Henry VII. attained a kingdom in which there was a
  Parliament to advise, but scarcely a Parliament to control."<a
  name="footnotetag24" href="#footnote24"><sup>[24]</sup></a></p>

  <p>It is important to note the ascendancy of the barons in the medieval
  Parliaments, and their self-destruction in the Wars of the Roses. Unless
  we realise how very largely the barons were the Parliament, it is
  difficult to understand how it came about that Parliament was so utterly
  impotent under the Tudors. The Wars of the Roses killed off the mighty
  parliamentarians, and it took a hundred years to raise the country
  landowners into a party which, under Eliot, Hampden, and Pym, was to make
  the House of Commons supreme.</p>

  <p>"The civil wars of many years killed out the old councils (if I might
  so say): that is, destroyed three parts of the greater nobility, who were
  its most potent members, tired the small nobility and gentry, and
  overthrew the aristocratic organisation on which all previous effectual
  resistance to the sovereign had been based."<a name="footnotetag25"
  href="#footnote25"><sup>[25]</sup></a></p>

  <p>To get an idea of the weakness of Parliament when the Tudors ruled, we
  have but to suppose at the present day a Parliament deprived of all
  front-bench men on both sides of the House, and of the leaders of the
  Irish and Labour parties, and a House of Lords deprived of all Ministers
  and ex-Ministers.</p>

<h4><font class="sc">The Medieval National Assemblies</font></h4>

  <p>Before passing to the Parliamentary revival of the seventeenth
  century, there still remain one or two points to be considered relating
  to the early national assemblies of the thirteenth and fourteenth
  centuries.</p>

  <p>(1) <i>Who were the electors in the Middle Ages?</i>&mdash;In the
  counties, all who were entitled to attend and take part in the
  proceedings of the county court had the right of electing the knight of
  the shire; and "it is most probable, on the evidence of records, on the
  analogies of representative usage, and on the testimony of later facts,
  that the knights of the shire were elected by the full county court."<a
  name="footnotetag26" href="#footnote26"><sup>[26]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The county court or shire-moot not only elected knights for
  Parliament; it often enough elected them for local purposes as well. The
  county coroner was elected in similar fashion by the county. All the
  chief tenants and small freeholders were therefore the county electors;
  but the tenants-in-chief (who held their lands from the Crown) and the
  knights of the county had naturally considerably more influence than the
  smaller men. "The chief lord of a great manor would have authority with
  his tenants, freeholders as they might be, which would make their
  theoretical equality a mere shadow, and would, moreover, be exercised all
  the more easily because the right which it usurped was one which the
  tenant neither understood nor cared for."<a name="footnotetag27"
  href="#footnote27"><sup>[27]</sup></a></p>

  <p>It is difficult to decide to what extent the smaller freeholders could
  take an active interest in the affairs of the county. As for the office
  of knight of the shire, there was no competition in the thirteenth or
  fourteenth century for the honour of going to Parliament, and it is
  likely enough that the sheriff, upon whom rested the responsibility for
  the elections, would in some counties be obliged to nominate and compel
  the attendance of an unwilling candidate.</p>

  <p>(2) <i>Payment of Parliamentary Representatives.</i>&mdash;The fact
  that Members of Parliament were paid by their constituents in the
  thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries<a name="footnotetag28"
  href="#footnote28"><sup>[28]</sup></a> made certain small freeholders as
  anxious not to be included in the electorate as others were anxious not
  to be elected to Parliament. It was recognised as "fair that those
  persons who were excluded from the election should be exempt from
  contribution to the wages. And to many of the smaller freeholders the
  exemption from payment would be far more valuable than the privilege of
  voting."<a name="footnotetag29" href="#footnote29"><sup>[29]</sup></a>
  But the Commons generally petitioned for payment to be made by all
  classes of freeholders, and when all allowance has been made for varying
  customs and for local diversities and territorial influence, it is safe
  to take it that the freeholders were the body of electors.</p>

  <p>In 1430, the eighth year of Henry VI., an Act was passed ordering that
  electors must be resident in the country, and must have free land or
  tenement to the value of 40s. a year at least; and this Act was in
  operation till 1831.</p>

  <p>The county franchise was a simple and straightforward matter compared
  with the methods of electing representatives from the boroughs. All that
  the sheriff was ordered to do by writ was to provide for the return of
  two members for each city or borough in his county; the places that were
  to be considered as boroughs were not named. In the Middle Ages a town
  might have no wish to be taxed for the wages of its Parliamentary
  representative, and in that case would do its best to come to an
  arrangement with the sheriff. (It was not till the sixteenth and
  seventeenth centuries that a considerable increase of boroughs took
  place. The Tudors created "pocket" and "rotten" boroughs in order to have
  the nominees of the Crown in Parliament.) The size of the borough bore no
  relation to its membership till the Reform Act of the nineteenth century,
  and as the selection of towns to be represented was arbitrary, so the
  franchise in the towns was equally unsettled. One or two places had a
  wide franchise, others confined the vote to freemen and corporation
  members. But in spite of the extraordinary vagaries of the borough
  franchise, and the arbitrary selection of towns to be represented, these
  early medieval Parliaments really did in an imperfect way represent the
  nation&mdash;all but the peasants and artisans.</p>

  <p>"Our English Parliaments were <i>un</i>symmetrical realities. They
  were elected anyhow. The sheriff had a considerable licence in sending
  writs to boroughs, that is, he could in part pick its constituencies; and
  in each borough there was a rush and scramble for the franchise, so that
  the strongest local party got it whether few or many. But in England at
  that time there was a great and distinct desire to know the opinion of
  the nation, because there was a real and close necessity. The nation was
  wanted to do something&mdash;to assist the sovereign in some war, to pay
  some old debt, to contribute its force and aid in the critical juncture
  of the time. It would not have suited the ante-Tudor kings to have had a
  fictitious assembly; they would have lost their sole <i>feeler</i>, their
  only instrument for discovering national opinion. Nor could they have
  manufactured such an assembly if they wished. Looking at the mode of
  election, a theorist would say that these Parliaments were but 'chance'
  collections of influential Englishmen. There would be many corrections
  and limitations to add to that statement if it were wanted to make it
  accurate, but the statement itself hits exactly the principal excellence
  of these Parliaments. If not 'chance' collections of Englishmen, they
  were 'undesigned' collections; no administrations made them, or could
  make them. They were bona fide counsellors, whose opinion might be wise
  or unwise, but was anyhow of paramount importance, because their
  co-operation was wanted for what was in hand."<a name="footnotetag30"
  href="#footnote30"><sup>[30]</sup></a></p>

  <p>(3) <i>The political position of women in the Middle
  Ages.</i>&mdash;Abbesses were summoned to the convocations of clergy in
  Edward I.'s reign. Peeresses were permitted to be represented by proxy in
  Parliament. The offices of sheriff, high constable, governor of a royal
  castle, and justice of the peace have all been held by women. In fact,
  the lady of the manor had the same rights as the lord of the manor, and
  joined with men who were freeholders in electing knights of the shire
  without question of sex disability.<a name="footnotetag31"
  href="#footnote31"><sup>[31]</sup></a> (A survival of the medieval rights
  of women may be seen in the power of women to present clergy to benefices
  in the Church of England.)</p>

  <p>In the towns women were members of various guilds and companies
  equally with men, and were burgesses and freewomen. Not till 1832 was the
  word "male" inserted before "persons" in the charters of boroughs. "Never
  before has the phrase 'male persons' appeared in any statute of the
  realm. By this Act (the Reform Bill), therefore, women were technically
  disfranchised for the first time in the history of the English
  Constitution. The privilege of abstention was converted into the penalty
  of exclusion."</p>

<h4><font class="sc">No Theory of Democracy in the Middle Ages</font></h4>

  <p>The years of Simon of Montfort and Edward I., which saw the beginnings
  of a representative national assembly, were not a time of theoretical
  discussion on political rights. The English nation, indeed, has ever been
  averse from political theories. The notion of a carefully balanced
  constitution was outside the calculations of medieval statesmen, and the
  idea of political democracy was not included among their visions.</p>

  <p>"Even the scholastic writers, amid their calculations of all possible
  combinations of principles in theology and morals, well aware of the
  difference between the 'rex politicus' who rules according to law, and
  the tyrant who rules without it, and of the characteristics of monarchy,
  aristocracy, and democracy, with their respective corruptions, contented
  themselves for the most part with balancing the spiritual and secular
  powers, and never broached the idea of a growth into political
  enfranchisement. Yet, in the long run, this has been the ideal towards
  which the healthy development of national life in Europe has constantly
  tended, only the steps towards it have not been taken to suit a
  preconceived theory."<a name="footnotetag32"
  href="#footnote32"><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Each step towards democracy has been taken "to suit the convenience of
  party or the necessities of kings, to induce the newly admitted classes
  to give their money, to produce political contentment."</p>

  <p>The only two principles that are apparent in the age-long struggles
  for political freedom in England, that are recognised and acknowledged,
  are: (1) That that which touches all shall be approved by all; (2) that
  government rests on the consent of the governed. Over and over again
  these two principles may be seen at work.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTERIII">CHAPTER III</a></h3>

<h3>POPULAR INSURRECTION IN ENGLAND</h3>

<h4><font class="sc">General Results of Popular Risings</font></h4>

  <p>Popular insurrection has never been successful in England; a violent
  death and a traitor's doom have been the lot of every leader of the
  common people who took up arms against the Government. The Civil War that
  brought Charles I. to the scaffold, and the Revolution that deposed James
  II. and set William of Orange on the throne, were the work of country
  gentlemen and Whig statesmen, not of the labouring people.</p>

  <p>But if England has never seen popular revolution triumphant and
  democracy set up by force of arms, the earlier centuries witnessed more
  than one effort to gain by open insurrection some measure of freedom for
  the working people of the land.</p>

  <p>No other way than violent resistance seemed possible to peasants and
  artisans in the twelfth, fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth centuries,
  if their wrongs were to be mitigated and their rulers to be called to
  account.</p>

  <p>Langton and Simon of Montfort had placed some check on the power of
  the Crown, had laid the foundations of political liberty, and marked the
  road to be travelled; but the lot of the labouring people remained
  unheeded and voiceless in the councils of the nation. What could they do
  but take up arms to end an intolerable oppression?</p>

<h4><font class="sc">William FitzOsbert, called Longbeard, 1196</font></h4>

  <p>The first serious protest came from the London workmen in the reign of
  Richard I.; and FitzOsbert, known as Longbeard, was the spokesman of the
  popular discontent.</p>

  <p>The King wanted money, chiefly for his crusades in Palestine. He had
  no inclination to personal government, and the business of ruling England
  was in the hands of Hubert Walter, Archbishop of Canterbury, the
  justiciar or King's lieutenant. Richard left England for Normandy in
  1194, and returned no more. England to him was a country where money
  could be raised, a subject-province to be bled by taxation. Archbishop
  Hubert did his best to satisfy the royal demands; and though by his
  inquisitions "England was reduced to poverty from one sea to the
  other"&mdash;it is estimated that more than £1,000,000 was sent to
  Richard in two years&mdash;the King was left unsatisfied. The nation
  generally came to hate the Archbishop's taxation, the Church suffered by
  his neglect, and he was finally compelled to resign the
  justiciarship.</p>

  <p>It was the London rising, under FitzOsbert's leadership, that directly
  caused Archbishop Hubert's retirement, and FitzOsbert is notable as the
  first of the long line of agitators.</p>

  <p>The political importance of the capital was seen in the reigns of Cnut
  and William the Conqueror. It was conspicuous on the arrival of Stephen
  in 1135, and its influence on national politics lasted till the middle of
  the nineteenth century.<a name="footnotetag33"
  href="#footnote33"><sup>[33]</sup></a></p>

  <p>By its charter London had the right of raising taxes for the Crown in
  its own way, and in 1196 the method proposed by the Corporation provoked
  the outbreak. "When the aldermen assembled according to usage in full
  hustings for the purpose of assessing the taxes, the rulers endeavoured
  to spare their own purses and to levy the whole from the poor"
  (Hoveden).</p>

  <p>The poorer citizens were voteless, and the plan of the aldermen was to
  levy the tallages per head, and not in proportion to the property of the
  inhabitants. This meant, practically, that the whole, except a very small
  fraction of the sum to be raised, must be paid by the working people.</p>

  <p>Thereupon FitzOsbert protested, and the people rose in arms against
  the demand.</p>

  <p>FitzOsbert was an old crusader, and he was something of a lawyer and a
  powerful speaker. Not a rich man by any means, FitzOsbert was yet a
  member of the city council when, "burning with zeal for justice and fair
  play, he made himself the champion of the poor." To his enemies he was a
  demagogue and disreputable&mdash;so Ralph de Diceto, Dean of St. Paul's
  at that time, described him. To others of more popular sympathies he was
  heroic and died a martyr's death. Across the centuries he is seen as "an
  agitator"&mdash;the first English agitator, the first man to stand up
  boldly against the oppression of the common people. This palpably unjust
  taxation of the poor was intolerable to FitzOsbert.</p>

  <p>Fifteen thousand men banded themselves together in London under an
  oath that they would stand by each other and by their leader; and
  FitzOsbert, after a vain journey to Normandy to arouse Richard's
  attention to the wrongs of his subjects, bade open defiance to the
  justiciar and his tax-gatherers.</p>

  <p>For a time the Archbishop's men were powerless, but weakness crept in
  amongst the citizens, and the aldermen were naturally on the side of
  constituted authority. FitzOsbert's success meant a readjustment of
  taxation quite unpalatable to the City Fathers.</p>

  <p>In the end FitzOsbert was deserted by all but a handful of his
  followers and fled with them for sanctuary to the church of St.
  Mary-le-Bow in Cheapside. Pursued by the officers of the law, FitzOsbert
  climbed up into the tower of the church, and to fetch him down orders
  were given to set the church on fire. This was done, and the only chance
  of life that now remained for the rebels was to get out of the church and
  cut their way through the ranks of their enemies.</p>

  <p>At the church door FitzOsbert was struck down, and his little company
  quickly overpowered.</p>

  <p>Heavily chained, and badly wounded, FitzOsbert was carried off to the
  Tower, to be tried and sentenced to a traitor's death without delay.</p>

  <p>A few days later&mdash;it was just before Easter&mdash;FitzOsbert was
  stripped naked, and dragged at the tail of a horse over the rough streets
  of London to Tyburn. He was dead before the place of execution was
  reached, but the body, broken and mangled, was hung up in chains under
  the gallows elm all the same; and nine of his companions were hanged with
  him.</p>

  <p>The very people who had fallen away from their leader in the day of
  his need now counted FitzOsbert for a saint, and pieces of his gibbet and
  of the bloodstained earth underneath the tree were carried away and
  treasured as sacred relics. It was alleged that miracles were performed
  when these relics were touched&mdash;so wide was now the popular
  reverence for the dead champion of the poor.</p>

  <p>Archbishop Hubert put a stop to this devotion by ordering sermons to
  be preached on FitzOsbert's iniquities; and an alleged death-bed
  confession, containing an account of many evil deeds, was published. It
  is likely enough that an old crusader had plenty of sins to answer for,
  but FitzOsbert's one crime before the law was that he had taught the
  people of London to stand up and resist by force of arms the payment of
  taxes&mdash;taxes levied with gross unfairness in popular judgment.</p>

  <p>The monks of Canterbury, to whom the church of St. Mary-le-Bow in
  Cheapside belonged, had long had their own quarrels with Archbishop
  Hubert, and on this firing of their church, and the violation of
  sanctuary, they appealed to the King and the Pope&mdash;Innocent
  III.&mdash;that Hubert should give up his political work and attend
  exclusively to his duties as Archbishop. Both the Pope and the great
  barons were against him, and in 1198 Archbishop Hubert was compelled to
  resign the judiciarship.</p>

<h4><font class="sc">The Peasant Revolt and its Leaders, 1381</font></h4>

  <p>The great uprising of the peasants in 1381 was a very different matter
  from the local insurrection made by FitzOsbert. Two centuries had passed,
  and in those centuries the beginnings of representative government had
  been set up and some recognition of the rights of the peasantry had been
  admitted in the Great Charter.</p>

  <p>The Peasant Revolt was national. It was carefully prepared and
  skilfully organised, and its leaders were men of power and
  ability&mdash;men of character. It was not only a definite protest
  against positive evils, but a vigorous attempt to create a new social
  order&mdash;to substitute a social democracy for feudal government.<a
  name="footnotetag34" href="#footnote34"><sup>[34]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The old feudal order had been widely upset by the Black Death in 1349,
  and the further ravages of pestilence in 1361 and 1369. The heavy
  mortality left many country districts bereft of labour, and landowners
  were compelled to offer higher wages if agriculture was to go on. In vain
  Parliament passed Statutes of Labourers to prevent the peasant from
  securing an advance. These Acts of Parliament expressly forbade a rise in
  wages; the landless man or woman was "to serve the employer who shall
  require him to do so, and take only the wages which were accustomed to be
  taken in the neighbourhood two years before the pestilence." The scarcity
  of labour drove landowners to compete for the services of the labourer,
  in spite of Parliament.</p>

  <p>Discontent was rife in those years of social change. The Statutes of
  Labourers were ineffectual; but they galled the labourers and kept
  serfdom alive. The tenants had their grievance because they were obliged
  to give labour-service to their lords. Freehold yeomen, town workmen, and
  shopkeepers were irritated by heavy taxation, and vexed by excessive
  market tolls. All the materials were at hand for open rebellion, and
  leaders were found as the days went by to kindle and direct the
  revolt.</p>

  <p>John Ball, an itinerant priest, who came from St. Mary's, at York, and
  then made Colchester the centre of his wanderings, spent twenty years
  organising the revolt, and three times was excommunicated and imprisoned
  by the Archbishop of Canterbury for teaching social "errors, schisms, and
  scandals," but was in no wise contrite or cast down.</p>

  <p>Chief of Ball's fellow-agitators were John Wraw, in Suffolk, Jack
  Straw, in Essex&mdash;both priests these&mdash;William Grindcobbe, in
  Hertford, and Geoffrey Litster, in Norfolk. In Kent lived Wat Tyler, of
  whom nothing is told till the revolt was actually afire, but who at once
  was acknowledged leader and captain by the rebel hosts.</p>

  <p>From village to village went John Ball in the years that preceded the
  rising, organising the peasants into clubs, and stirring the people with
  revolutionary talk. It was the way of this vagrant priest to preach to
  the people on village greens, and his discourses were all on the same
  text&mdash;"In the beginning of the world there were no bondmen, all men
  were created equal."<a name="footnotetag35"
  href="#footnote35"><sup>[35]</sup></a> Inequalities of wealth and social
  position were to be ended:</p>

  <p>"Good people, things will never go well in England, so long as goods
  be not kept in common, and so long as there be villeins and gentlemen. By
  what right are they whom men call lords greater folk than we? If all come
  from the same father and mother, Adam and Eve, how can they say or prove
  that they are better than we, if it be not that they make us gain for
  them by our toil what they spend in their pride?</p>

  <p>"They are clothed in velvet, and are warm in their furs and ermines,
  while we are covered in rags. They have wine and spices and fair bread,
  and we oatcake and straw, and water to drink. They have leisure and fine
  houses; we have pain and labour, the wind and rain in the fields. And yet
  it is of us and of our toil that these men hold their state.</p>

  <p>"We are called slaves; and if we do not perform our services, we are
  beaten, and we have not any sovereign to whom we can complain, or who
  wishes to hear us and do us justice."</p>

  <p>The poet, William Langland, in "Piers Plowman," dwelt on the social
  wrongs of the time; Ball was fond of quoting from Langland, and of
  harping on a familiar couplet:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"When Adam delved and Eve span,</p>
      <p>Who was then the gentleman?"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Besides the sermons, some of the rhymed letters that John Ball sent
  about the country have been preserved:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"John Ball, Priest of St. Mary's, greets well all manner of men, and
  bids them in the name of the Trinity, Father, Son and Holy Ghost, to
  stand together manfully in truth. Help truth and truth shall help
  you.</p>

</blockquote>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"John Ball greeteth you all,</p>
      <p class="i2">And doth to understand he hath rung your bell.</p>
      <p>Now with right and might, will and skill,</p>
      <p class="i2">God speed every dell.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>John the Miller asketh help to turn his mill right:</p>
      <p class="i2">He hath ground small, small:</p>
      <p class="i2">The King's Son of Heaven will pay for it all.</p>
      <p>Look thy mill go right, with its four sails dight.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>With right and with might, with skill and with will,</p>
      <p class="i2">And let the post stand in steadfastness.</p>
      <p>Let right help might, and skill go before will,</p>
      <p class="i2">Then shall our mill go aright;</p>
      <p>But if might go before right, and will go before skill,</p>
      <p class="i2">Then is our mill mis-a-dight."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Sometimes it is under the signature of John Trueman that John Ball
  writes:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"Beware ere ye be woe;</p>
      <p>Know your friend from your foe;</p>
      <p>Take enough and cry "Ho!"</p>
      <p>And do well and better and flee from sin,</p>
      <p>And seek out peace and dwell therein&mdash;</p>
      <p class="i2">So biddeth John Trueman and all his fellows."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>A more definite note was struck when it seemed to Ball and his
  colleagues that the time was ripe for revolution, and the word was given
  that appeal must be made to the boy-king&mdash;Richard was only eleven
  years old when he came to the throne in 1377.</p>

  <p>"Let us go to the King, and remonstrate with him, telling him we must
  have it otherwise, or we ourselves shall find the remedy. He is young. If
  we wait on him in a body, all those who come under the name of serf, or
  are held in bondage, will follow us in the hope of being free. When the
  King shall see us we shall obtain a favourable answer, or we must then
  ourselves seek to amend our condition."</p>

  <p>In another letter John Ball greets John Nameless, John the Miller, and
  John Carter, and bids them stand together in God's name, and beware of
  guile: he bids Piers Plowman "go to his work and chastise well Hob the
  Robber (Sir Robert Hales, the King's Treasurer); and take with you John
  Trueman and all his fellows, and look that you choose one head and no
  more."</p>

  <p>These letters and the preaching were accepted by willing minds. John
  Ball was in prison&mdash;in the jail of Archbishop Sudbury at
  Maidstone&mdash;in the spring of 1381, but the peasants were organised
  and ready to revolt. If Wat Tyler is the recognised leader of the rebel
  forces&mdash;"the one head"&mdash;John Ball's was the work of preparing
  the uprising. The vagrant priest had rung his bell to some purpose. In
  every county, from Somerset to York, the peasants flocked together, "some
  armed with clubs, rusty swords, axes, with old bows reddened by the smoke
  of the chimney corner, and odd arrows with only one feather."</p>

  <p>At Whitsuntide, early in June, 1381, the great uprising
  began&mdash;the Hurling time of the peasants&mdash;long to be remembered
  with horror by the governing classes. A badly ordered poll-tax was the
  match that kindled the fire.</p>

  <p>The poll-tax was first levied, in 1377, on all over fourteen years of
  age. Two years later it was graduated, every man and woman of the working
  class being rated at 4d., and dukes and archbishops at £6 13s. 4d. More
  money was still wanted by the Government, and early in 1381, John of
  Gaunt, the chief man in the realm, called Parliament together at
  Northampton, and demanded £160,000. Parliament agreed that £100,000
  should be raised, and the clergy&mdash;owning a third of the
  land&mdash;promised £60,000. But the only way of raising the £100,000
  that the Government could think of was by another poll-tax, and this time
  everybody over fifteen was required to pay 1s. Of course, the thing was
  impossible. In many parishes the mere returns of population were not
  filled in; numbers evaded payment&mdash;which spelt ruin&mdash;by leaving
  their homes. £22,000 was all that came to hand.</p>

  <p>Then a man named John Legge came to the assistance of the Government,
  and was appointed chief commissioner, and empowered to collect the
  tax.</p>

  <p>The methods of Legge and his assistants provoked hostility, and when
  the villagers of Fobbing, Corringham, and Stanford-le-Hope, in Essex,
  were summoned to meet the commissioner at Brentwood, their reply was to
  kill the collectors.</p>

  <p>The Government answered this by sending down Chief Justice Belknap to
  punish the offenders, but the people drove the chief justice out of the
  place, and Belknap was glad to escape with his life.</p>

  <p>This was on Whit-Sunday, June 2nd, and two days later the revolt had
  spread to Kent; Gravesend and Dartford were in tumult. In one place Sir
  Simon Burley, a friend of Richard II., seized a workman, claiming him as
  a bondservant, and refusing to let him go under a fine of £300; while at
  Dartford a tax-collector had made trouble by gross indecency to the wife
  and daughter of one John Tyler.<a name="footnotetag36"
  href="#footnote36"><sup>[36]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Thereupon this John Tyler, "being at work in the same town tyling of
  an house, when he heard thereof, caught his lathing staff in his hand,
  and ran reaking home; where, reasoning with the collector, who made him
  so bold, the collector answered with stout words, and strake at the
  tyler; whereupon the tyler, avoiding the blow, smote the collector with
  his lathing staff, so that the brains flew out of his head. Wherethrough
  great noise arose in the streets, and the poor people being glad,
  everyone prepared to support the said John Tyler."</p>

  <p>Now, with the fire of revolt in swift blaze, it was for the men of
  Kent to see that it burned under some direction. Authority and discipline
  were essential if the rising was not to become mob rule or mere anarchy,
  and if positive and intolerable wrongs were to find remedies.</p>

  <p>At Maidstone, on June 7th&mdash;after Rochester Castle had been
  stormed, its prisoners set free and Sir John Newton its governor placed
  in safe custody&mdash;Wat Tyler was chosen captain of the rebel
  hosts.</p>

  <p>History tells us nothing of the antecedents of this remarkable man.
  For eight days, and eight days only, he plays his part on the stage of
  national events: commands with authority a vast concourse of men; meets
  the King face to face, and wrests from sovereignty great promises of
  reform; orders the execution of the chief ministers of the Crown, and
  then, in what seems to be the hour of triumph, is struck to the ground,
  and goes to his death.</p>

  <p>Under the accredited leadership of Wat Tyler the revolt at once took
  form. Five days were spent in Kent before the peasant army marched on
  London. The manor houses were attacked, and all rent rolls, legal
  documents, lists of tenants and serfs destroyed. The rising was not a
  ferocious massacre like the rising of the Jacquerie in France; there was
  no general massacre of landlords, or reign of terror. The lawyers who
  managed the landowners' estates were the enemy, and against
  them&mdash;against the instruments of landlord tyranny&mdash;was the
  anger of the peasants directed. In the same way John of Gaunt, and not
  the youthful King, was recognised as the evil influence in government;
  and while a vow was taken by the men of Kent that no man named "John"
  should be King of England, the popular cry was "King Richard and the
  Commons," and all who joined in this were accounted friends of the
  insurgent populace.</p>

  <p>Blackheath was reached on the evening of June 12th, and early the
  following morning, which was Corpus Christi Day, John Ball&mdash;released
  by a thousand hands from his prison at Maidstone&mdash;preached to the
  multitude on the work before them:</p>

  <p>"Now is the opportunity given to Englishmen, if they do but choose to
  take it, of casting off the yoke they have borne so long, of winning the
  freedom they have always desired. Wherefore, let us take good courage and
  behave like the wise husbandman of scripture, who gathered the wheat into
  his barn, but uprooted and burned the tares that had half-choked the good
  grain. The tares of England are her oppressive rulers, and the time of
  harvest has come. Ours it is to pluck up these tares and make away with
  them all&mdash;the wicked lords, the unjust judges, the
  lawyers&mdash;every man, indeed, who is dangerous to the common good.
  Then shall we all have peace in our time and security for the future. For
  when the great ones have been rooted up and cast away, all will enjoy
  equal freedom and nobility, rank and power shall we have in common."</p>

  <p>Thirty-thousand men&mdash;yeomen, craftsmen, villeins, and peasants,
  were at Blackheath, and these were soon joined by thousands more from
  Surrey.</p>

  <p>John Wraw and Grindcobbe came to consult with Wat Tyler, and then
  returned to Suffolk and Hertford to announce that the hour had come to
  strike.</p>

  <p>The Marshalsea and King's Bench prisons, and the houses of ill-fame
  that clustered round London Bridge, were destroyed before Wat Tyler led
  his army into the city. An attempt to meet the King in conference was
  frustrated by the royal counsellors. Richard came down in the royal barge
  as far as Rotherhithe, but was dissuaded by Sir Robert Hales, and the
  Earls of Suffolk, Salisbury, and Warwick, from "holding speech with the
  shoeless ruffians."</p>

  <p>Richard rowed back swiftly to the Tower, and Tyler and his army swept
  into London. The city was in the hands of the rebel captain, but the
  citizens welcomed the invaders, and offered bread and ale when Tyler
  proclaimed that death would be the instant punishment for theft.</p>

  <p>John of Gaunt's palace at the Savoy, on the river strand, was the
  first place to be burnt; but Henry, Earl of Derby, John of Gaunt's son
  (eighteen years later to reign as Henry IV., in place of Richard), was
  allowed to pass out uninjured, and a wretched man caught in the act of
  stealing off with a silver cup was promptly executed.</p>

  <p>The Savoy destroyed, the Temple&mdash;a hive of lawyers&mdash;was the
  next to be burnt, and before nightfall the Fleet Prison and Newgate had
  been demolished.</p>

  <p>Again Tyler demanded conference with the King, and Richard, lying in
  the Tower with his counsellors, unable to prevent the work of conference,
  boldly decided to come out and meet the rebels. Mile End was appointed
  for the conference, and to Mile End Richard came with a very modest
  retinue. The King was only fifteen, but he was the son of the Black
  Prince, and he had both courage and cunning. He was fully aware that the
  people did not lay on him responsibility for the sins of the Government.
  "If we measure intellectual power by the greatest exertion it ever
  displays, rather than by its average results, Richard II. was a man of
  considerable talents. He possessed along with much dissimulation a
  decisive promptitude in seizing the critical moment for action."<a
  name="footnotetag37" href="#footnote37"><sup>[37]</sup></a></p>

  <p>At Mile End Tyler stated the grievances of the people. But first he
  asked that all traitors should be put to death, and to this the King
  agreed.</p>

  <p>Four positive articles of reform were put forward, and were at once
  assented to by the King:&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. A free and general pardon to all concerned in the rising.</p>

  <p>2. The total abolition of all villeinage (forced labour) and
  serfdom.</p>

  <p>3. An end to all tolls and market dues&mdash;"freedom to buy and sell
  in all cities, burghs, mercantile towns, and other places within our
  kingdom of England."</p>

  <p>4. All customary tenants to become leaseholders at a fixed rental of
  fourpence an acre for ever.</p>

  <p>That all doubts might be removed, thirty clerks were set to work on
  the spot to draw up charters of manumission, and banners were presented
  to each county. At nightfall thousands returned home convinced that the
  old order was ended, and that the Royal charters were genuine assurances
  of freedom.</p>

  <p>But Tyler and the bulk of the men of Kent and Surrey remained in the
  city. It seemed to Wat Tyler that better terms still were to be wrung
  from the King. It looked that night as though the insurrection had
  triumphed completely. Not only were the charters signed and the royal
  promises given, but several in high office, whom Tyler held to be
  "traitors," had gone to their doom. Sir Robert Hales, the Treasurer,
  Archbishop Sudbury, the Chancellor&mdash;a gentle and kindly old man,
  "lenient to heretics"&mdash;John Legge, the hated poll-tax commissioner,
  with Appleton, John of Gaunt's chaplain, and Richard Lyons, a thoroughly
  corrupt contractor of Edward III.'s reign, were all dragged out of the
  Tower and beheaded on Tower Hill on Friday, June 15th.</p>

  <p>On Tyler's request for another conference with Richard on the
  following day, the King saw he had no choice but to yield. For the second
  time Wat Tyler and Richard met face to face. The conference was held at
  Smithfield, in the square outside St. Bartholomew's Priory. The King and
  two hundred retainers, with Walworth the mayor, were on the east side of
  the square. Tyler and his army were on the west side, opposite the
  Priory.</p>

  <p>In the open space Tyler, mounted on a little horse, presented his
  demands; more sweeping were the reforms now asked for than those of the
  previous day.</p>

  <p>"Let no law but the law of Winchester<a name="footnotetag38"
  href="#footnote38"><sup>[38]</sup></a> prevail throughout the land, and
  let no man be made an outlaw by the decree of judges and lawyers. Grant
  also that no lord shall henceforth exercise lordship over the commons;
  and since we are oppressed by so vast a horde of bishops and clerks, let
  there be but one bishop in England; and let the property and goods of
  Holy Church be divided fairly according to the needs of the people in
  each parish, after in justice making suitable provision for the present
  clergy and monks. Finally, let there be no more villeins in England, but
  grant us all to be free and of one condition."</p>

  <p>Richard answered that he promised readily all that was asked, "if only
  it be consistent with the regality of my Crown." He then bade the commons
  return home, since their requests had been granted.</p>

  <p>Nobles and counsellors stood in sullen and silent anger at the King's
  words, but were powerless to act. Tyler, conscious of victory, called for
  a draught, and when his attendant brought him a mighty tankard of ale,
  the rebel leader drank good-humouredly to "King Richard and the Commons."
  A knight in the royal service, a "valet of Kent," was heard to mutter
  that Wat Tyler was the greatest thief and robber in all the county, and
  Tyler caught the abusive words, drew his dagger, and made for the
  man.</p>

  <p>Mayor Walworth, as angry as the nobles at the King's surrender,
  shouted that he would arrest all who drew weapons in the King's presence;
  and on Tyler striking at him impatiently, the Mayor drew a cutlass and
  slashed back, wounding Tyler in the neck so that he fell from his horse.
  Before he could recover a footing, two knights plunged their swords into
  him, and Tyler, mortally wounded, could only scramble on to his little
  horse, ride a yard or two, call on the commons to avenge him, and then
  drop&mdash;a dead man.<a name="footnotetag39"
  href="#footnote39"><sup>[39]</sup></a></p>

  <p>And with Wat Tyler's death the whole rebellion collapsed. Confusion
  fell upon the people at Smithfield. Some were for immediate attack, but
  when Richard, riding out into the middle of the square, claimed that he
  and not Tyler was their King, and bade them follow him into the fields
  towards Islington, the great mass, convinced that Richard was honestly
  their friend, obeyed. At nightfall they were scattered.</p>

  <p>Wat Tyler's body was taken into the Priory, and his head placed on
  London Bridge.</p>

  <p>Walworth hastily gathered troops together, and the leader of the
  rebels being dead, the nobles recovered their courage.</p>

  <p>The rising was over; the people without leaders were as sheep for the
  slaughter. Jack Straw was taken in London and hanged without the
  formality of a trial; and on June 22nd Tresilian, the new chief justice,
  went on a special assize to try the rebels, and "showed mercy to none and
  made great havock." The King's charters and promises were declared null
  and void when Parliament met, and some hundreds of peasants were hanged
  in various parts of the country.</p>

  <p>John Ball and Grindcobbe were hanged at St. Albans on July 15th, John
  Wraw and Geoffrey Litster suffered the same fate.</p>

  <p>All that Wat Tyler and the peasants had striven for was lost; but the
  rising was not quite in vain. For one thing, the poll-tax was stopped,
  and the end of villeinage was hastened.</p>

  <p>The great uprising was the first serious demonstration of the English
  people for personal liberty. "It taught the King's officers and gentle
  folks that they must treat the peasants like men if they wished them to
  behave quietly, and it led most landlords to set free their bondsmen, and
  to take fixed money payments instead of uncertain services from their

<h4><font class="sc">Jack Cade, Captain of Kent, 1450</font></h4>

  <p>To understand the character and importance of the rising of the men of
  Kent under Jack Cade in 1450, the first thing to be done is to clear the
  mind of Shakespeare's travesty in <i>King Henry VI.</i>, Part 2. In the
  play the name of Cade has been handed down in obloquy, and all that he
  and his followers aimed at caricatured out of recognition. The part that
  Jack Cade really played in national affairs has no likeness to the low
  comedy performance imagined by Shakespeare.</p>

  <p>It was a popular rising in 1450, but it was not a peasant revolt. Men
  of substance in the county rallied to Cade's banner, and in many parishes
  in Kent the village constable was employed to enrol willing recruits in
  the army of disaffection.<a name="footnotetag41"
  href="#footnote41"><sup>[41]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The peasant revolt was at bottom a social movement, fostered and
  fashioned by preachers of a social democracy. Cade's rising was provoked
  by misgovernment and directed at political reform. It was far less
  revolutionary in purpose than the revolt that preceded it, or the rising
  under Ket a hundred years later.</p>

  <p>The discontent was general when Cade encamped on Blackheath with the
  commons of Kent at the end of May, 1450. Suffolk, the best hated of Henry
  VI.'s ministers, had already been put to death by the sailors of Dover,
  and Lord Say-and-Sele, the Treasurer, was in the Tower under impeachment.
  Ayscough, Bishop of Salisbury, another Minister, was hanged by his
  infuriated flock in Wiltshire, and Bishop Moleyns, of Chichester, Keeper
  of the Privy Seal, was executed in Portsmouth by a mob of sailors. Piracy
  prevailed unchecked in the English Channel, and the highways inland were
  haunted by robbers&mdash;soldiers back from France and broken in the
  wars.</p>

  <p>The ablest statesman of the day, the Duke of York, was banished from
  the royal council, and there was a wide feeling that an improvement in
  government was impossible until York was recalled.</p>

  <p>Whether Cade, who was known popularly as "Mortimer," was related to
  the Duke of York, or was merely a country landowner, can never be
  decided. The charges made against him after his death were not supported
  by a shred of evidence, but it was necessary then for the Government to
  blacken the character of the Captain of Kent for the utter discouragement
  of his followers. All we <i>know</i> of Cade is that by the Act of
  Attainder he must have been a man of some property in
  Surrey&mdash;probably a squire or yeoman.</p>

  <p>The army that encamped on Blackheath numbered over 40,000, and
  included squires, yeomen, county gentlemen, and at least two notable
  ecclesiastics from Sussex, the Abbot of Battle and the Prior of Lewes.
  The testimony to Cade's character is that he was the unquestioned and
  warmly respected leader of the host. The Cade depicted by his
  enemies&mdash;a dissolute, disreputable ruffian&mdash;was not the kind of
  man to have had authority as a chosen captain over country gentlemen and
  clerical landowners in the fifteenth century.</p>

  <p>The "Complaints" of the commons of Kent, drawn up at Blackheath and
  forwarded to the King and his Parliament, then sitting at Westminster,
  called attention in fifteen articles to the evils that afflicted the
  land. These articles dealt with a royal threat to lay waste Kent in
  revenge for the death of the Duke of Suffolk; the wasting of the royal
  revenue raised by heavy taxation; the banishment of the Duke of
  York&mdash;"to make room for unworthy ministers who would not do justice
  by law, but demanded bribes and gifts"; purveyance of goods for the royal
  household without payment; arrest and imprisonment on false charges of
  treason by persons whose goods and lands were subsequently seized by the
  King's servants, who then "either compassed their deaths or kept them in
  prison while they got possession of their property by royal grant";
  interference by "the great rulers of the land" with the old right of free
  election of knights of the shire; the mismanagement of the war in France.
  A certain number of purely local grievances, chiefly concerned with the
  maladministration of justice, were also included in the "Complaints," and
  five "Requests"&mdash;including the abolition of the Statutes of
  Labourers&mdash;were added.</p>

  <p>Henry and his counsellors dismissed these "Complaints" with contempt.
  "Such proud rebels," it was said, "should rather be suppressed and tamed
  with violence and force than with fair words or amicable answer." But
  when the royal troops moved into Kent to disperse the rising, Cade's army
  cut them to pieces at Sevenoaks. Henry returned to London; his nobles
  rode away to their country houses; and after a fruitless attempt at
  negotiations by the Duke of Buckingham and the Archbishop of
  Canterbury,<a name="footnotetag42" href="#footnote42"><sup>[42]</sup></a>
  the King himself fled to Kenilworth&mdash;leaving London at the mercy of
  the Captain of Kent.</p>

  <p>On July 2nd Cade crossed London Bridge on horseback, followed by all
  his army. The Corporation had already decided to offer no opposition to
  his entry, and one of its members, Thomas Cocke, of the Drapers'
  Company&mdash;later sheriff and M.P.&mdash;had gone freely between the
  camp at Blackheath and the city, acting as mutual friend to the rebels
  and the citizens. All that Cade required was that the foreign merchants
  in London should furnish him with a certain number of arms and horses,
  "and 1,000 marks of ready money"; and this was done. "So that it was
  found that the Captain and Kentishmen at their being in the city did no
  hurt to any stranger."<a name="footnotetag43"
  href="#footnote43"><sup>[43]</sup></a></p>

  <p>On the old London stone, in Cannon Street, Cade laid his sword, in the
  presence of the Mayor and a great multitude of people, and declared
  proudly: "Now is Mortimer lord of this city." Then at nightfall he went
  back to his headquarters at the White Hart Inn in Southwark.</p>

  <p>The following day Lord Say-and-Sele, and his son-in-law, Crowmer,
  Sheriff of Kent, were removed by Cade's orders from the Tower to the
  Guildhall, tried for "divers treasons" and "certain extortions," and
  quickly beheaded. Popular hatred, not content with this, placed the heads
  of the fallen minister and his son-in-law on poles, made them kiss in
  horrible embrace, and then bore them off in triumph to London Bridge.</p>

  <p>A third man, one John Bailey, was also hanged for being a necromancer;
  and as Cade had promised death to all in his army convicted of theft, it
  fell out that certain "lawless men" paid the penalty for disobedience,
  and were hanged in Southwark&mdash;where the main body of the army
  lay.</p>

  <p>Cade's difficulties began directly after Lord Say-and-Sele's
  execution. London assented willingly to the death of an unpopular
  statesman, but had no mind to provision an army of 50,000 men, and,
  indeed, had no liking for the proximity of such a host. Plunder being
  forbidden, and strict discipline the rule, the urgent question for the
  Captain of Kent was how the army was to be maintained.</p>

  <p>Getting no voluntary help from the city. Cade decided that he must
  help himself. He supped with a worthy citizen named Curtis in Tower
  Street on July 4th, and insisted before he left that Curtis must
  contribute money for the support of the Kentish men. Curtis
  complied&mdash;how much he gave we know not&mdash;but he resented
  bitterly the demand, and he told the tale of his wrongs to his
  fellow-merchants.<a name="footnotetag44"
  href="#footnote44"><sup>[44]</sup></a> The result was that while Cade
  slept in peace as usual at the White Hart, the Mayor and Corporation took
  counsel with Lord Scales, the Governor of the Tower, and resolved that at
  all costs the Captain of Kent and his forces must be kept out of the
  city. After the treatment of Curtis the fear was that disorder and
  pillage might become common.</p>

  <p>On the evening of Sunday, July 5th, and all through the night battle
  waged hotly on London Bridge, which had been seized and fortified before
  Cade was awake, and by the morning the rebels, unsuccessful in their
  attack, were glad to agree to a hasty truce.</p>

  <p>The truce gave opportunity to Cardinal Kemp, Archbishop of York, the
  King's Chancellor, to suggest a lasting peace to Cade. Messengers were
  sent speedily from the Tower, where Kemp, with Archbishop Stafford, of
  Canterbury, had stayed in safety, to the White Hart, urging a conference
  "to the end that the civil commotions and disturbances might cease and
  tranquillity be restored."</p>

  <p>Cade consented, and when the two Archbishops, with William Waynfleet,
  Bishop of Winchester, met the Captain of Kent in the Church of St.
  Margaret, Southwark, and promised that Parliament should give
  consideration to the "Complaints" and "Requests" of the commons, and that
  a full pardon should be given to all who would straightway return home,
  the rising was at an end.</p>

  <p>Cade hesitated, and asked for the endorsement of the pardons by
  Parliament; but this was plainly impossible because Parliament was not
  sitting. The bulk of the commons were satisfied with their pardons, and
  with the promise that Parliament would attend to their grievances. There
  was nothing to be gained, it seemed, by remaining in arms. On July 8th,
  the rebel army had broken up, taking the road back to the towns and
  villages, farms and cottages in Kent, Sussex, and Surrey. Cade, with a
  small band of followers, retreated to Rochester, and attempted without
  success, the capture of Queenborough Castle. On the news that the commons
  had dispersed from Southwark, the Government at once took the offensive.
  Alexander Iden was appointed Sheriff of Kent, and, marrying Crowmer's
  widow, subsequently gained considerable profit. Within a week John Cade
  was proclaimed by the King's writ a false traitor throughout the
  countryside, and Sheriff Iden was in eager pursuit&mdash;for a reward of
  1,000 marks awaited the person who should take Cade, alive or dead.</p>

  <p>Near Heathfield, in Sussex, Cade, broken and famished, was found by
  Iden, and fought his last fight on July 13th, preferring to die sword in
  hand than to perish by the hangman. He fell before the overwhelming odds
  of the sheriff and his troops, and the body was immediately sent off to
  London for identification.</p>

  <p>The landlady of the White Hart proved the identity of the dead
  captain, and all that remained was to stick the head on London Bridge,
  and dispatch the quartered body to Blackheath, Norwich, Salisbury and
  Gloucester for public exhibition.</p>

  <p>Iden got the 1,000 marks reward and, in addition, the governorship of
  Rochester Castle at a salary of £36 a year.</p>

  <p>By special Act of Attainder all Cade's goods, lands and tenements were
  made forfeit to the Crown, and statements were published for the
  discrediting of Cade's life.</p>

  <p>No allusion was made in Parliament to the "Complaints" and "Requests,"
  and, in spite of Cardinal Kemp's pardons, a number of men were hanged at
  Canterbury and Rochester for their share in the rising, when Henry VI.
  and his justices visited Kent in January, 1451.</p>

  <p>The revolt failed to amend the wretched misrule. It remained for civil
  war to drive Henry VI. from the throne, and make Edward IV. of York his
  successor.</p>

<h4><font class="sc">The Norfolk Rising under Robert Ket, 1549</font></h4>

  <p>A century after the rising of the commons of Kent came the last great
  popular rebellion&mdash;the Norfolk Rising, led by Ket. This insurrection
  was agrarian and social, concerned neither with the fierce theological
  differences of the time, nor with the political rivalries of Protector
  Somerset and his enemies in Edward VI.'s Council.</p>

  <p>At the beginning of the sixteenth century England was in the main a
  nation of small farmers, but radical changes were taking place, and these
  changes meant ruin to thousands of yeomen and peasants.</p>

  <p>The enclosure, by many large landowners, of the fields which for ages
  past had been cultivated by the country people, the turning of arable
  land into pasture, were the main causes of the distress.<a
  name="footnotetag45" href="#footnote45"><sup>[45]</sup></a> Whole
  parishes were evicted in some places and dwelling houses destroyed, and
  contemporary writers are full of the miseries caused by these
  clearances.</p>

  <p>Acts of Parliament were passed in 1489 and 1515, prohibiting the
  "pulling down of towns," and ordering the reversion of pasture lands to
  tillage, but the legislation was ignored. Sir Thomas More, in his
  "Utopia" (1516), described very vividly what the enclosures were doing to
  rural England; and a royal commission, appointed by Cardinal Wolsey,
  reported in the following year that more than 36,000 acres had been
  enclosed in seven Midland counties. In some cases, waste lands only were
  enclosed, but landowners were ordered to make restitution within forty
  days where small occupiers had been dispossessed. Royal commissions and
  royal proclamations were no more effective than Acts of Parliament. Bad
  harvests drove the Norfolk peasantry to riot for food in 1527 and 1529.
  The dissolution of the monasteries in 1536 and 1539 abolished a great
  source of charity for the needy, and increased the social disorder.
  Finally, in 1547, came the confiscation by the Crown of the property of
  the guilds and brotherhoods, and the result of this enactment can only be
  realised by supposing the funds of friendly societies, trade unions, and
  co-operative societies taken by Government to-day without
  compensation.</p>

  <p>All that Parliament would do in the face of the starvation and
  unemployment that brooded over many parts of England, was to pass penal
  legislation for the homeless and workless&mdash;so that it seemed to many
  that Government had got rid of Papal authority only to bring back
  slavery. The agrarian misery, the violent changes in the order of church
  services and social customs, the confiscation of the funds of the guilds,
  and the wanton spoiling of the parish churches<a name="footnotetag46"
  href="#footnote46"><sup>[46]</sup></a>&mdash;all these things drove the
  people to revolt.</p>

  <p>Early in 1549 the men of Devon and Cornwall took up arms for "the old
  religion," and were hanged by scores. In Norfolk that same year the
  rising under Ket was social, and unconcerned with religion. Lesser
  agrarian disturbances took place in Somerset, Lincoln, Essex, Kent,
  Oxford, Wilts, and Buckingham. But there was no cohesion amongst the
  insurgents, and no organisation of the peasants such as England had seen
  under John Ball and his companion in 1381.</p>

  <p>In 1548 Somerset, the Lord Protector, made an honest attempt to check
  the rapacity of the landowners, but his proclamation and royal commission
  were no more successful than Wolsey's had been, and only earned for the
  Protector the hatred of the landowners.</p>

  <p>The Norfolk Rising was the one strong movement to turn the current
  that was sweeping the peasants into destitution. It failed, as all
  popular insurrection in England has failed, and it brought its leaders to
  the gallows; but for six weeks hope lifted its head in the rebel camp
  outside Norwich, and many believed that oppression and misery were to
  end.</p>

  <p>The rising began at Attleborough, on June 20th, when the people pulled
  down the fences and hedges set up round the common fields. On July 7th,
  at the annual feast in honour of St. Thomas of Canterbury, at Wymondham,
  a mighty concourse of people broke down the fences at Hetherset, and then
  appealed to Robert Ket and his brother to help them.</p>

  <p>Both the Kets were well-known locally. They were men of old family,
  craftsmen, and landowners. Robert was a tanner by trade, William a
  butcher. Three manors&mdash;valued at 1,000 marks, with a yearly income
  of £50&mdash;belonged to Robert Ket: church lands mostly, leased from the
  Earl of Warwick.</p>

  <p>Ket saw that only under leadership and guidance could the revolt
  become a revolution, and he threw himself into the cause of his poorer
  neighbours with whole-hearted fervour. "I am ready," he said, "and will
  be ready at all times to do whatever, not only to repress, but to subdue
  the power of great men. Whatsoever lands I have enclosed shall again be
  made common unto ye and all men, and my own hands shall first perform it.
  You shall have me, if you will, not only as a companion, but as a
  captain; and in the doing of the so great a work before us, not only as a
  fellow, but for a leader, author, and principal."</p>

  <p>Ket's leadership was at once acclaimed with enthusiasm by the thousand
  men who formed the rebel band at the beginning of the rising. The news
  spread quickly that Ket was leading an army to Norwich, and on July 10th,
  when a camp was made at Eaton Wood, every hour brought fresh recruits. It
  is clear from Ket's speeches, and from "The Rebels' Complaint," issued by
  him at this time, that the aim of the leaders of the Norfolk Rising was
  not merely to stop the enclosures, but to end the ascendancy of the
  landlord class for all time, and to set up a social democracy.</p>

  <p>Ket's address at Eaton Wood was revolutionary:</p>

  <p>"Now are ye overtopped and trodden down by gentlemen, and put out of
  possibility ever to recover foot. Rivers of riches run into the coffers
  of your landlords, while you are par'd to the quick, and fed upon pease
  and oats like beasts. You are fleeced by these landlords for their
  private benefit, and as well kept under by the public burdens of State,
  wherein while the richer sort favour themselves, ye are gnawn to the very
  bones. Your tyrannous masters often implead, arrest, and cast you into
  prison, so that they may the more terrify and torture you in your minds,
  and wind your necks more surely under their arms.... Harmless counsels
  are fit for tame fools; for you who have already stirred, there is no
  hope but in adventuring boldly."</p>

  <p>"The Rebels' Complaint" is equally definite and outspoken. It
  rehearsed the wrongs of a landless peasantry, and called on the people to
  end these wrongs by open rebellion. The note of social equality is struck
  by Ket throughout the rising.</p>

  <p>"The present condition of possessing land seemeth miserable and
  slavish&mdash;holding it all at the pleasure of great men; not freely,
  but by prescription, and, as it were, at the will and pleasure of the
  lord. For as soon as any man offend any of these gorgeous gentlemen, he
  is put out, deprived, and thrust from all his goods.</p>

  <p>"The common pastures left by our predecessors for our relief and our
  children are taken away.</p>

  <p>"The lands which in the memory of our fathers were common, those are
  ditched and hedged in and made several; the pastures are enclosed, and we
  shut out.</p>

  <p>"We can no longer bear so much, so great, and so cruel injury; neither
  can we with quiet minds behold so great covetousness, excess, and pride
  of the nobility. We will rather take arms, and mix Heaven and earth
  together, than endure so great cruelty.</p>

  <p>"Nature hath provided for us, as well as for them; hath given us a
  body and a soul, and hath not envied us other things. While we have the
  same form, and the same condition of birth together with them, why should
  they have a life so unlike unto ours, and differ so far from us in
  calling?</p>

  <p>"We see that things have now come to extremities, and we will prove
  the extremity. We will rend down hedges, fill up ditches, and make a way
  for every man into the common pasture. Finally, we will lay all even with
  the ground, which they, no less wickedly than cruelly and covetously,
  have enclosed.</p>

  <p>"We desire liberty and an indifferent (or equal) use of all things.
  This will we have. Otherwise these tumults and our lives shall only be
  ended together."</p>

  <p>But though the method was revolution and the goal social democracy,
  Ket was no anarchist. He proved himself a strong, capable leader, able to
  enforce discipline and maintain law and order in the rebel camp. And with
  all his passionate hatred against the rule of the landlord, Ket would
  allow neither massacre nor murder. There is no evidence that the life of
  a single landowner was taken while the rising lasted, though many were
  brought captive to Ket's judgment seat.</p>

  <p>Ket was equally averse from civil war between the citizens of Norwich
  and the peasants. When the Mayor of Norwich, Thomas Cod, refused to allow
  Ket's army to cross the city on its way to Mousehold Heath, where the
  permanent camp was to be made, Ket simply led his forces round by
  Hailsdon and Drayton, and so reached Mousehold on July 12th without
  bloodshed. A week later, and 20,000 was the number enrolled under the
  banner of revolt&mdash;for the publication of "The Rebels' Complaint" and
  the ringing of bells and firing of beacons roused all the countryside to
  action.</p>

  <p>On Mousehold Heath, Robert Ket, with his brother William, gave
  directions and administered justice under a great tree, called the Oak of
  Reformation. Mayor Cod, and two other respected Norwich citizens,
  Aldrich, an alderman, and Watson, a preacher, joined Ket's council,
  thinking their influence might restrain the rebels from worse doings.</p>

  <p>Twenty-nine "Requests and Demands," signed by Ket, Cod, and Aldrich,
  were dispatched to the King from Mousehold, and this document gave in
  full the grievances of the rebels. The chief demands were the cessation
  of enclosures, the enactment of fair rents, the restoration of common
  fishing rights, the appointment of resident clergymen to preach and
  instruct the children, and the free election or appointment of local
  "commissioners" for the enforcement of the laws. There was also a request
  "that all bond men may be made free, for God made all free with His
  precious bloodshedding."</p>

  <p>The only answer to the "Requests and Demands" was the arrival of a
  herald with a promise that Parliament would meet in October to consider
  the grievances, if the people would in the meantime quietly return to
  their homes.</p>

  <p>But this Ket would by no means agree to, and for the next few weeks
  his authority was supreme in that part of the country. He established a
  rough constitution for the prevention of mere disorder, two men being
  chosen by their fellows from the various hundreds of the eastern half of
  the county. A royal messenger, bearing commissions of the peace to
  certain country gentlemen, falling into the hands of Ket, was relieved of
  his documents and dismissed. Ket then put in these commissions the names
  of men who had joined the rising, and declared them magistrates with
  authority to check all disobedience to orders.</p>

  <p>To feed the army at Mousehold, men were sent out with a warrant from
  Ket for obtaining cattle and corn from the country houses, and "to beware
  of robbing, spoiling, and other evil demeanours." No violence or injury
  was to be done to "any honest or poor man." Contributions came in from
  the smaller yeomen "with much private good-will," but the landowners
  generally were stricken with panic, and let the rebels do what they
  liked. Those who could not escape by flight were, for the most part,
  brought captive to the Oak of Reformation, and thence sent to the prisons
  in Norwich and St. Leonard's Hill.</p>

  <p>Relations between Ket and the Norwich authorities soon became strained
  to breaking point. Mayor Cod was shocked at the imprisonment of county
  gentlemen, and refused permission for Ket's troops to pass through the
  city on their foraging expeditions. Citizens and rebels were in conflict
  on July 21st, but "for lack of powder and want of skill in the gunners"
  few lives were lost, and Norwich was in the hands of Ket the following
  day. No reprisals followed; but a week later came William Parr, Marquis
  of Northampton&mdash;Henry VIII.'s brother-in-law&mdash;with 1,500
  Italian mercenaries and a body of country squires, to destroy the rebels.
  Northampton's forces were routed utterly, and Lord Sheffield was slain,
  and many houses and gates were burnt in the city.</p>

  <p>Then for three weeks longer Robert Ket remained in power, still hoping
  against hope that some attention would be given by the Government to his
  "Requests and Demands." Protector Somerset, beset by his own
  difficulties, could do nothing for rebellious peasants, could not
  countenance in any way an armed revolt, however great the miseries that
  provoked insurrection. The Earl of Warwick was dispatched with 14,000
  troops to end the rebellion, and arrived on August 24th. For two days the
  issue seemed uncertain&mdash;half the city only was in Warwick's hands.
  The arrival of 1,400 mercenaries&mdash;"lanzknechts," Germans
  mostly&mdash;and a fatal decision of the rebels to leave their vantage
  ground at Mousehold Heath and do battle in the open valley that stretched
  towards the city, gave complete victory to Warwick.</p>

  <p>The peasants poured into the meadows beyond Magdalen and Pockthorpe
  gates, and were cut to pieces by the professional soldiers.</p>

  <p>When all seemed over Ket galloped away to the north, but was taken,
  worn out, at the village of Swannington, eight miles from Norwich.</p>

  <p>More than 400 peasants were hanged by Warwick's orders, and their
  bodies left to swing on Mousehold and in the city. Robert Ket and William
  Ket were sent to London, and after being tried and condemned for high
  treason, were returned to Norwich in December for execution. Robert Ket
  was hanged in chains from Norwich Castle, and William suffered in similar
  fashion from the parish church at Wymondham&mdash;to remind all people of
  the fate that befall those who venture, unsuccessfully, to take up arms
  against the government in power.</p>

  <p>So the Norfolk Rising ended, and with it ended all serious popular
  insurrection in England. Riots and mob violence have been seen even to
  our own time, but no great, well-organised movement to overthrow
  authority and establish a social democracy by force of arms has been
  attempted since 1549.</p>

  <p>The characters of Robert Ket and his brother have been vindicated by
  time, and the rebel leader is now recognised as a disinterested, capable,
  high-minded man. Ket took what seemed to him the only possible course to
  avert the doom of a ruined peasantry, and failed. But his courage and
  humaneness are beyond question.<a name="footnotetag47"
  href="#footnote47"><sup>[47]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The enclosures did not end with the sixteenth century, and for another
  one hundred years complaints are heard of the steady depopulation of
  rural England. In the eighteenth century came the second great series of
  enclosures&mdash;the enclosing of the commons and waste spaces, by Acts
  of Parliament. Between 1710 and 1867 no less than 7,660,439 acres were
  thus enclosed.</p>

  <p>To-day the questions of land tenure and land ownership are conspicuous
  items in the discussion of the whole social question, for the relations
  of a people to its land are of very first importance in a democratic
  state.</p>

  href="#footnote49"><sup>[49]</sup></a> And then it is also to be borne in
  mind that both Henry and Elizabeth made a point of getting Parliament to
  do their will. They governed through Parliament, and ruled triumphantly,
  for it is only in the later years of Elizabeth that any discontent is
  heard. The Stuarts, far less tyrannical, came to grief just because they
  never understood the importance of Parliament in the eyes of Englishmen
  in the middle ranks, and attempted to rule while ignoring the House of
  Commons.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth scolded her Parliaments, and more than once called the
  Speaker of the House of Commons to account. The business of Tudor
  Parliaments was to decree the proposals of the Crown. "Liberty of speech
  was granted in respect of the aye or no, but not that everybody should
  speak what he listed." Bacon declared, "the Queen hath both enlarging and
  restraining power; she may set at liberty things restrained by statute
  and may restrain things which be at liberty."</p>

  <p>Yet Elizabeth raised no objection to the theory that Parliament was
  the sovereign power, for her authority controlled Parliament; and so we
  have Sir Thomas Smith writing in 1589 that "the most high and absolute
  power of the realm of England consisteth in the Parliament."</p>

  <p>In his "Ecclesiastical Polity," Book I. (1592-3), Hooker argues that
  "Laws human, of what kind soever are available by consent," and that
  "laws they are not which public approbation hath not made so"; deciding
  explicitly that sovereignty rests ultimately in the people.</p>

<h4><font class="sc">Victory of Parliament over the Stuarts</font></h4>

  <p>When he came to the throne in 1603, James I. was prepared to govern
  with all the Tudor absolutism, but he had neither Elizabeth's
  Ministers&mdash;Cecil excepted&mdash;nor her knowledge of the English
  mind. The English Parliament and the English people had put up with
  Elizabeth's headstrong, capricious rule, because it had been a strong
  rule, and the nation had obviously thriven under it.<a
  name="footnotetag50" href="#footnote50"><sup>[50]</sup></a> But it was
  another matter altogether when James I. was king.</p>

  <p>"By many steps the slavish Parliament of Henry VIII. grew into the
  murmuring Parliament of Queen Elizabeth, the mutinous Parliament of James
  I., and the rebellious Parliament of Charles I."</p>

  <p>The twenty years of James I.'s reign saw the preaching up of the
  doctrine of the divine right of kings by the bishops of the Established
  Church, and the growing resolution of the Commons to revive their earlier
  rights and privileges. If the Stuarts were as unfortunate in their choice
  of Ministers as Elizabeth had been successful, the House of Commons was
  equally happy in the remarkable men who became its spokesmen and leaders.
  In the years that preceded the Civil War&mdash;1626-42&mdash;three men
  are conspicuous on the Parliamentary side: Eliot, Hampden, and Pym. All
  three were country gentlemen, of good estate, high principle, and
  religious convictions<a name="footnotetag51"
  href="#footnote51"><sup>[51]</sup></a>&mdash;men of courage and
  resolution, and of blameless personal character. Eliot died in prison, in
  the cause of good government, in 1632; Hampden fell on Chalgrove Field in
  1643.</p>

  <p>As in earlier centuries the struggle in the seventeenth century
  between the King and the Commons turned mainly on the questions of
  taxation. (At the same time an additional cause of dispute can be found
  in the religious differences between Charles I. and the Parliamentarians.
  The latter were mainly Puritan, accepting the Protestantism of the Church
  of England, but hating Catholicism and the high-church views of Laud. The
  King was in full sympathy with high Anglicanism, and, like his father,
  willing to relax the penal laws against Catholics.)</p>

  <p>"By the ancient laws and liberties of England it is the known
  birthright and inheritance of the subject that no tax, tallage, or other
  charge shall be levied or imposed but by common consent in England, and
  that the subsidies of tonnage and poundage are no way due or payable but
  by a free gift and special Act of Parliament."</p>

  <p>In these memorable words began the declaration moved by Sir John Eliot
  in the House of Commons on March 2nd, 1629. A royal message ordering the
  adjournment of the House was disregarded, the Speaker was held down in
  his chair, and the key of the House of Commons was turned against
  intrusion, while Eliot's resolutions, declaring that the privileges of
  the Commons must be preserved, were carried with enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>Charles answered these resolutions by dissolving Parliament and
  sending Eliot to the Tower.</p>

  <p>For eleven years no Parliament was summoned. Eliot refused altogether
  to make any defence for his Parliamentary conduct. "I hold that it is
  against the privilege of Parliament to speak of anything which is done in
  the House," was his reply to the Crown lawyers. So Sir John Eliot was
  left in prison, for nothing would induce this devoted believer in
  representative government to yield to the royal pressure, and three years
  later, at the age of forty-two, he died in the Tower.</p>

  <p>It was for the liberties of the House of Commons that Eliot gave his
  life. Wasted with sickness, health and freedom were his if he would but
  acknowledge the right of the Crown to restrain the freedom of
  Parliamentary debate; but such an acknowledgment was impossible from Sir
  John Eliot. For him the privilege of the House of Commons in the matter
  of free speech was a sacred cause, to be upheld by Members of Parliament,
  even to the death&mdash;a cause every whit as sacred to Eliot as the
  divine right of kings was to the Stuart bishops.</p>

  <p>Charles hoped to govern England through his Ministers without
  interference from the Commons, and only the need of money compelled him
  to summon Parliament.</p>

  <p>John Hampden saw that if the King could raise money by forced loans
  and other exactions, the days of constitutional government were over.
  Hence his memorable resistance to ship-money. London and the seaports
  were induced to provide supplies for ships in 1634, on the pretext that
  piracy must be prevented. In the following year the demand was extended
  to the inland counties, and Hampden refused point blank to
  pay&mdash;though the amount was only a matter of 20s.&mdash;falling back,
  in justification of his refusal, on the Petition of
  Right&mdash;acknowledged by Charles in 1628&mdash;which declared that
  taxes were not to be levied without the consent of Parliament. The case
  was decided in 1636, and five of the twelve judges held that Hampden's
  objection was valid. The arguments in favour of non-payment were
  circulated far and wide, so that, in spite of the adverse verdict, "the
  judgment proved of more advantage and credit to the gentleman condemned
  than to the King's service."<a name="footnotetag52"
  href="#footnote52"><sup>[52]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The personal rule of Charles and his Ministers, Laud and Strafford,
  came to an end in the autumn of 1640, when there was no choice left to
  the King but to summon Parliament, if money was to be obtained. Earlier
  in the year the "Short Parliament" had met, only to be dissolved by the
  folly of the King after a sitting of three weeks, because of its
  unwillingness to vote supplies without the redress of grievances.</p>

  <p>The disasters of the King's campaign against the Scots, an empty
  treasury, and a mutinous army, compelled the calling of Parliament. But
  the temper of the men who came to the House of Commons in November was
  vastly different from the temper of the "Short Parliament."<a
  name="footnotetag53" href="#footnote53"><sup>[53]</sup></a> For this was
  the famous "Long Parliament" that assembled in the dark autumn days of
  1640, and it was to sit for thirteen years; to see the impeachment and
  execution of Laud and Strafford, the trial and execution of the King, the
  abolition of monarchy and the House of Lords, the establishment of the
  Commonwealth; and was itself to pass away finally only before Cromwell's
  military dictatorship.</p>

  <p>Hampden was the great figure at the beginning of this Parliament. "The
  eyes of all men were fixed upon him, as their <i>patriæ pater</i>, and
  the pilot that must steer the vessel through the tempests and rocks which
  threatened it. I am persuaded (wrote Clarendon) his power and interest at
  that time were greater to do good or hurt than any man's in the kingdom,
  or than any man of his rank hath had at any time; for his reputation of
  honesty was universal, and his affections seemed so publicly guided, that
  no corrupt or private ends could bias them."</p>

  <p>Politically, neither Hampden nor Pym was Republican. Both believed in
  government by King, Lords, and Commons; but both were determined that the
  King's Ministers should be answerable to Parliament for the policy of the
  Crown, and that the Commons, who found the money for government, should
  have a definite say in the spending of that money. As for the royal claim
  of "Divine right," and the royal view that held passive obedience to be
  the duty of the King's subjects, and saw in Parliament merely a useful
  instrument for the raising of funds to be spent by the royal pleasure
  without question or criticism&mdash;these things were intolerable to
  Hampden, Pym, and the men of the House of Commons. The King would not
  govern through Parliament; the House of Commons could govern without a
  King. It was left to the Civil War to decide the issue between the Crown
  and Parliament, and make the House of Commons supreme.</p>

  <p>Things moved quickly in the first year of the Long Parliament. The
  Star Chamber and High Commission Courts were abolished. Strafford was
  impeached for high treason, and executed on Tower Hill. Archbishop Laud
  lay in prison, to be executed four years later. The Grand Remonstrance of
  the House of Commons was presented to Charles in December, 1641. The
  demands of the Commons in the Remonstrance were not revolutionary, but
  they stated, quite frankly, the case for the Parliament. The main points
  were the need for securities for the administration of justice, and an
  insistence on the responsibility of the King's Ministers to the Houses of
  Parliament. The Grand Remonstrance was only carried by eleven votes in
  the House of Commons, 159 to 148, after wild scenes. "Some waved their
  hats over their heads, and others took their swords in their scabbards
  out of their belts, and held them by the pummels in their hands, setting
  the lower part on the ground." Actual violence was only prevented "by the
  sagacity and great calmness of Mr. Hampden, by a short speech."</p>

  <p>Charles promised an answer to the deputation of members who waited
  upon him with the Grand Remonstrance, and early in the new year came the
  reply. The King simply demanded the surrender of five members&mdash;Pym,
  Hampden, Holles, Strode, and Hazlerig&mdash;and their impeachment on the
  charge of high treason. All constitutional law was set aside by a charge
  which proceeded personally from the King, which deprived the accused of
  their legal right to a trial by their peers, and summoned them before a
  tribunal which had no pretence to a justification over them. On the
  refusal of the Commons to surrender their members, Charles came in person
  to Westminster with 300 cavaliers to demand their arrest. But the five
  members, warned of the King's venture, were well out of the way, and
  rested safely within the City of London&mdash;for the citizens were
  strongly for the Parliament. "It was believed that if the King had found
  them there (in the House of Commons), and called in his guards to have
  seized them, the members of the House would have endeavoured the defence
  of them, which might have proved a very unhappy and sad business."</p>

  <p>As it was, Charles could only retire "in a more discontented and angry
  passion than he came in." The step was utterly ill-advised. Parliament
  was in no mood to favour royal encroachments, and the citizens of London
  were at hand, with their trained bands, to protect forcibly members of
  the House of Commons.</p>

  <p>War was now imminent. "The attempt to seize the five members was
  undoubtedly the real cause of the war. From that moment, the loyal
  confidence with which most of the popular party were beginning to regard
  the King was turned into hatred and suspicion. From that moment, the
  Parliament was compelled to surround itself with defensive arms. From
  that moment, the city assumed the appearance of a garrison.</p>

  <p>"The transaction was illegal from beginning to end. The impeachment
  was illegal. The process was illegal. The service was illegal. If Charles
  wished to prosecute the five members for treason, a bill against them
  should have been sent to a grand jury. That a commoner cannot be tried
  for high treason by the Lords at the suit of the Crown, is part of the
  very alphabet of our law. That no man can be arrested by the King in
  person is equally clear. This was an established maxim of our
  jurisprudence even in the time of Edward the Fourth. 'A subject,' said
  Chief Justice Markham to that Prince, 'may arrest for treason; the King
  cannot; for, if the arrest be illegal, the party has no remedy against
  the King.'"<a name="footnotetag54"
  href="#footnote54"><sup>[54]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Both King and Parliament broke rudely through all constitutional
  precedents in their preparations for hostilities.</p>

  <p>The King levied troops by a royal commission, without any advice from
  Parliament, and Pym got an ordinance passed, in both Houses, appointing
  the Lords-Lieutenant of the counties to command the Militia without
  warrant from the Crown.</p>

  <p>A last attempt at negotiations was made at York, in April, when the
  proposals of Parliament&mdash;nineteen propositions for curtailing the
  power of the Monarchy in favour of the Commons&mdash;were rejected by
  Charles with the words: "If I granted your demands, I should be no more
  than the mere phantom of a king."</p>

  <p>By August, Charles had raised the royal standard at Nottingham, and
  war was begun.</p>

  <p>Five years later and Charles was a prisoner, to die in 1649 on the
  scaffold. That same year monarchy and the House of Lords were abolished
  by law; the Established Church had already fallen before the triumphant
  arms of the Puritans.</p>

  <p>Then, in 1653, the House of Commons itself fell&mdash;expelled by
  Cromwell; and the task of the Lord Protector was to fashion a
  constitution that would work.<a name="footnotetag55"
  href="#footnote55"><sup>[55]</sup></a> What happened was the supremacy of
  the army. Parliament, attenuated and despised, contended in vain against
  the Protector. On Cromwell's death, and the failure of his son, Richard,
  the army declared for Charles II., and there was an end to the
  Commonwealth.</p>

<h4><font class="sc">The Democratic Protest&mdash;Lilburne</font></h4>

  <p>In all these changes the great mass of the people had neither part nor
  lot; and the famous leaders of the Parliamentary Party, resolute to
  curtail the absolutism of the Crown, were no more concerned with the
  welfare of the labouring people than the barons were in the time of John.
  The labouring people&mdash;generally&mdash;were equally indifferent to
  the fortunes of Roundheads and Cavaliers, though the townsmen in many
  places held strong enough opinions on the matters of religion that were
  in dispute.<a name="footnotetag56"
  href="#footnote56"><sup>[56]</sup></a></p>

  <p>That the common misery of the people was not in any way lightened by
  Cromwell's rule we have abundant evidence, and it cannot be supposed that
  the substitution of the Presbyterian discipline for episcopacy in the
  Church, and the displacement of Presbyterians by Independents, was likely
  to alleviate this misery.</p>

  <p>Taxation was heavier than it had ever been before, and in Lancashire,
  Westmorland, and Cumberland the distress was appalling.</p>

  <p>Whitelocke, writing in 1649,<a name="footnotetag57"
  href="#footnote57"><sup>[57]</sup></a> notes "that many families in
  Lancashire were starved." "That many in Cumberland and Westmorland died
  in the highways for want of bread, and divers left their habitations,
  travelling with their wives and children to other parts to get relief,
  but could find none. That the committees and Justices of the Peace of
  Cumberland signed a certificate, that there were 30,000 families that had
  neither seed nor bread-corn, nor money to buy either, and they desired a
  collection for them, which was made, but much too little to relieve so
  great a multitude."</p>

  <p>Cromwell, occupied with high affairs of State, had neither time nor
  inclination to attend to social reform. Democracy had its witnesses;
  Lilburne and the Levellers made their protest against military rule, and
  were overpowered; Winstanley and his Diggers endeavoured to persuade the
  country that the common land should be occupied by dispossessed peasants,
  and were quickly suppressed.</p>

  <p>Lilburne was concerned with the establishment of a political
  democracy, Winstanley with a social democracy, and in both cases the
  propaganda was offensive to the Protector.</p>

  <p>Had Cromwell listened to Lilburne, and made concessions towards
  democracy, the reaction against Puritanism and the Commonwealth might
  have been averted.<a name="footnotetag58"
  href="#footnote58"><sup>[58]</sup></a></p>

  <p>John Lilburne had been a brave soldier in the army of the Parliament
  in the early years of the Civil War, and he left the army in 1645 with
  the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel (and with £880 arrears of pay due to him)
  rather than take the covenant and subscribe to the requirements of the
  "new model."</p>

  <p>The monarchy having fallen, Lilburne saw the possibilities of tyranny
  in the Parliamentary government, and at once spoke out. With considerable
  legal knowledge, a passion for liberty, clear views on democracy, an
  enormous capacity for work, and great skill as a pamphleteer, Lilburne
  was not to be ignored. The Government might have had him for a supporter;
  it unwisely decided to treat him as an enemy, and for ten years he was an
  unsparing critic, his popularity increasing with every fresh pamphlet he
  issued&mdash;and at every fresh imprisonment.</p>

  <p>Lilburne urged a radical reform of Parliament and a general manhood
  suffrage in 1647, and the "Case for the Army," published by the Levellers
  in the same year, on the proposal of the Presbyterian majority in
  Parliament that the army should be disbanded, demanded the abolition of
  monopolies, freedom of trade and religion, restoration of enclosed common
  lands, and abolition of sinecures.</p>

  <p>Both Cromwell and Ireton were strongly opposed to manhood suffrage,
  and Cromwell&mdash;to whom the immediate danger was a royalist
  reaction&mdash;had no patience for men who would embark on democratic
  experiments at such a season.</p>

  <p>Lilburne and the Levellers were equally distrustful of Cromwell's new
  Council of State. "We were ruled before by King, Lords, and Commons, now
  by a General, Court-martial, and Commons; and, we pray you, what is the
  difference?" So they put the question in 1648.</p>

  <p>To Cromwell the one safety for the Commonwealth was in the loyalty of
  the army to the Government. To Lilburne the one guarantee for good
  government was in the supremacy of a Parliament elected by manhood
  suffrage. He saw plainly that unless steps were taken to establish
  democratic institutions there was no future for the Commonwealth; and he
  took no part in the trial of Charles I., saying openly that he doubted
  the wisdom of abolishing monarchy before a new constitution had been
  drawn up.</p>

  <p>But Lilburne overestimated the strength of the Leveller movement in
  the army, and the corporals who revolted were shot by sentence of
  courts-martial.<a name="footnotetag59"
  href="#footnote59"><sup>[59]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In vain the democratic troopers argued, "the old king's person and the
  old lords are but removed, and a new king and new lords with the commons
  are in one House, and so we are under a more absolute arbitrary monarchy
  than before." The Government answered by clapping Lilburne in the Tower,
  where, in spite of a petition signed by 80,000 for his release, he
  remained for three months without being brought to trial. Released on
  bail, Lilburne, who from prison had issued an "Agreement of the Free
  People," calling for annual parliaments elected by manhood suffrage and
  the free election of unendowed church ministers in every parish, now
  published an "Impeachment for High Treason against Oliver Cromwell and
  his son-in-law, James Ireton," and declared that monarchy was preferable
  to a military despotism. At last, brought to trial on the charge of
  "treason," Lilburne was acquitted with "a loud and unanimous shout" of
  popular approval.<a name="footnotetag60"
  href="#footnote60"><sup>[60]</sup></a> "In a revolution where others
  argued about the respective rights of King and Parliament, he spoke
  always of the rights of the people. His dauntless courage and his power
  of speech made him the idol of the mob."<a name="footnotetag61"
  href="#footnote61"><sup>[61]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Lilburne was again brought to trial, in 1653, and again acquitted,
  with undiminished enthusiasm. But "for the peace of the nation," Cromwell
  refused to allow the irrepressible agitator to be at large, and for two
  years Lilburne, "Free-born John," was kept in prison. During those years
  all power in the House of Commons was broken by the rule of the Army of
  the Commonwealth, and Parliament stood in abject submission before the
  Lord Protector. Only when his health was shattered, and he had embraced
  Quaker principles, was Lilburne released, and granted a pension of 40s. a
  week. The following year, at the age of 40, Lilburne died of
  consumption&mdash;brought on by the close confinement he had suffered. A
  year later, 1658, and Cromwell, by whose side Lilburne had fought at
  Marston Moor, and against whose rule he had contended for so many a year,
  was dead, and the Commonwealth Government was doomed.</p>

<h4><font class="sc">Winstanley and "The Diggers"</font></h4>

  <p>The "Digger" movement was a shorter and much more obscure protest on
  behalf of the people than Lilburne's agitation for democracy; but it is
  notable for its social significance.</p>

  <p>While Lilburne strove vigorously for political reforms that are still
  unaccomplished, Gerrard Winstanley preached a revolutionary gospel of
  social reform&mdash;as John Ball and Robert Ket had before him. But
  Winstanley's social doctrine allowed no room for violence, and included
  the non-resistance principles that found exposition in the Society of
  Friends. Hence the "Diggers," preaching agrarian revolution; but denying
  all right to force of arms, never endangered the Commonwealth Government
  as Lilburne and the Levellers did.</p>

  <p>Free Communism was the creed of more than one Protestant sect in the
  sixteenth century, and the Anabaptists on the Continent had been
  conspicuous for their experiments in community of goods and anarchist
  society.</p>

  <p>Winstanley confined his teaching and practice to common ownership of
  land, pleading for the cultivation of the enclosed common lands, "that
  all may feed upon the crops of the earth, and the burden of poverty be
  removed." There was to be no forcible expropriation of landlords.</p>

  <p>"If the rich still hold fast to this propriety of Mine and Thine, let
  them labour their own lands with their own hands. And let the common
  people, that say the earth is <i>ours</i>, not <i>mine</i>, let them
  labour together, and eat bread together upon the commons, mountains, and
  hills.</p>

  <p>"For as the enclosures are called such a man's land, and such a man's
  land, so the Commons and Heath are called the common people's. And let
  the world see who labour the earth in righteousness, and those to whom
  the Lord gives the blessing, let them be the people that shall inherit
  the earth.</p>

  <p>"None can say that their right is taken from them. For let the rich
  work alone by themselves; and let the poor work together by
  themselves."<a name="footnotetag62"
  href="#footnote62"><sup>[62]</sup></a></p>

  <p>With the common ownership and cultivation of land, an end was to be
  made of all tyranny of man over his fellows.</p>

    <h4>JOHN HAMPDEN</h4>

    <i>After the Engraving by G. Houbraken.</i>
  </div>
  <p>"Leave off dominion and lordship one over another; for the whole bulk
  of mankind are but one living earth. Leave off imprisoning, whipping, and
  killing, which are but the actings of the curse. Let those that have
  hitherto had no land, and have been forced to rob and steal through
  poverty; henceforth let them quietly enjoy land to work upon, that
  everyone may enjoy the benefit of his creation, and eat his own bread
  with the sweat of his own brow."</p>

  <p>Winstanley's argument was quite simple:</p>

  <p>"If any man can say that he makes corn or cattle, he may say, <i>That
  is mine</i>. But if the Lord made these for the use of His creation,
  surely then the earth was made by the Lord to be a Common Treasury for
  all, not a particular treasury for some."</p>

  <p>Two objections were urged against private property in land:</p>

  <p>"First, it hath occasioned people to steal from one another. Secondly,
  it hath made laws to hang those that did steal. It tempts people to do an
  evil action, and then kills them for doing it." It was a prolific age for
  pamphlets, the seventeenth century; the land teemed with preachers and
  visionaries, and Winstanley's writings never attracted the sympathy that
  was given to the fierce controversialists on theological and political
  questions.</p>

  <p>Only when Winstanley and his Diggers set to work with spade and shovel
  on the barren soil of St. George's Hill, in Surrey, in the spring of
  1649, was the attention of the Council of State called to the strange
  proceedings. The matter was left to the local magistrates and landowners,
  and the Diggers were suppressed. A similar attempt to reclaim land near
  Wellingboro' was stopped at once as "seditious and tumultuous." It was
  quite useless for Winstanley to maintain that the English people were
  dispossessed of their lands by the Crown at the Norman Conquest, and that
  with the execution of the King the ownership of the Crown lands ought to
  revert to the people; Cromwell and the Council of State had no more
  patience with prophets of land nationalisation than with agitators of
  manhood suffrage. Indeed, the Commonwealth Government never took the
  trouble to distinguish between the different groups of disaffected
  people, but set them all down as "Levellers," to be punished as
  disturbers of the peace if they refused to obey authority.</p>

  <p>Winstanley's last pamphlet was "True Magistracy Restored," an open
  letter to Oliver Cromwell, 1652, and after its publication Gerrard
  Winstanley and his Diggers are heard of no more.</p>

  <p>To-day both Lilburne and Winstanley are to be recalled because the
  agitation for political democracy is always with us, and the question of
  land tenure is seen to be of profound importance in the discussion of
  social reform. No democratic statesman in our time can propose an
  improvement in the social condition of the people without reference to
  the land question, and no social reformer of the nineteenth century has
  had more influence or been more widely read and discussed than Henry
  George&mdash;the exponent of the Single Tax on Land Values.</p>

  <p>Winstanley was very little heeded in his own day, but two hundred and
  fifty years later the civilised countries of the earth are found in deep
  debate over the respective rights of landowners and landless, and the
  relation of poverty to land ownership. State ownership, taxation of land
  values, peasant proprietorship, co-operative agriculture&mdash;all have
  their advocates to-day, but to Winstanley's question whether the earth
  was made "for to give ease to a few or health to all," only one answer is
  returned.</p>

<h4><font class="sc">The Restoration</font></h4>

  <p>Under the Commonwealth the landowners were as powerful as they had
  been under the monarchy. Enclosures continued. Social reform was not
  contemplated by Cromwell nor by Councils of State; democracy was equally
  outside the political vision of government. Church of England ministers
  were dispossessed in favour of Nonconformists, Puritanism became the
  established faith, Catholicism remained proscribed.</p>

  <p>The interest in ecclesiastical and theological disputes was
  considerable, and Puritanism was popular with large numbers of the
  middle-class. But to the mass of the people Puritanism was merely the
  suppression of further liberties, the prohibition of old customs, the
  stern abolition of Christmas revels and May-day games.</p>

  <p>Lilburne did his best to get Cromwell to allow the people some
  responsibility in the choice of its rulers. Winstanley proposed a remedy
  for the social distress. To neither of these men was any concession made,
  and no consideration was given to their appeals.</p>

  <p>Hence the bulk of the nation, ignored by the Commonwealth Government,
  and alienated by Puritanism, accepted quite amiably&mdash;indeed, with
  enthusiasm&mdash;the restoration of the monarchy on the return of Charles
  II., and was unmoved by the royalist reaction against Parliamentary
  Government that followed on the Restoration.</p>

  <p>The House of Commons itself, when Monk and his army had gone over to
  the side of Charles, voted, in the Convention Parliament of 1660, "that
  according to the ancient and fundamental laws of this Kingdom, the
  government is, and ought to be, by King, Lords, and Commons," and Charles
  II. was received in London with uproarious enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>The army was disbanded; a royalist House of Commons restored the
  Church of England and ordered general acceptance of its Prayer Book.
  Puritanism, driven from rule, could only remain in power in the heart and
  conscience of its adherents.</p>

  <p>To the old Commonwealth man it might seem, in the reaction against
  Puritanism, and in the popularity of the King, that all that had been
  striven for in the civil war had been lost, in the same way as after the
  death of Simon of Montfort it might have appeared that "the good cause"
  had perished with its great leader. In reality the House of Commons stood
  on stronger ground than ever, and was to show its strength when James II.
  attempted to override its decisions. In the main the very forms of
  Parliamentary procedure were settled in the seventeenth century, to
  remain undisturbed till the nineteenth century. "The Parliamentary
  procedure of 1844 was essentially the procedure on which the House of
  Commons conducted its business during the Long Parliament."<a
  name="footnotetag63" href="#footnote63"><sup>[63]</sup></a></p>

  <p>With Charles II. on the throne the absolutism of the Crown over
  Parliament passed for ever from England. Cromwell had set up the
  supremacy of the army over the Commons: this, too, was gone, never to be
  restored.</p>

  <p>Henceforth government was to be by King, Lords, and Commons; but
  sovereignty was to reside in Parliament. Not till a century later would
  democracy again be heard of, and its merits urged, as Lilburne had urged
  them under the Commonwealth.</p>

<h3>CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNMENT&mdash;ARISTOCRACY
TRIUMPHANT</h3>

<h4><font class="sc">Government by Aristocracy</font></h4>

  <p>For nearly two centuries&mdash;from 1660 to 1830&mdash;England was
  governed by an aristocracy of landowners. Charles II. kept the throne for
  twenty-five years, because he had wit enough to avoid an open collision
  with Parliament. James II. fled the country after three
  years&mdash;understanding no more than his father had understood that
  tyranny was not possible save by consent of Parliament or by military
  prowess. At the Restoration the royal prerogative was dead, and nothing
  in Charles II.'s reign tended to diminish the power of Parliament in
  favour of the throne. Charles was an astute monarch who did not wish to
  be sent on his travels again, and consequently took care not to outrage
  the nation by any attempt upon the liberties of Parliament. Only by the
  Tudor method of using Parliament as the instrument of the royal will
  could James II. have accomplished the constitutional changes he had set
  his heart upon. In attempting to set up toleration for the Roman Catholic
  religion, and in openly appointing Roman Catholics to positions of
  importance, James II. set Parliament at defiance and ranged the forces of
  the Established Church against himself. The method was doomed to failure.
  "None have gone about to break Parliaments but in the end Parliaments
  have broken them."<a name="footnotetag64"
  href="#footnote64"><sup>[64]</sup></a> In any case the notion of
  restoring political liberty to Catholics was a bold endeavour in 1685.
  Against the will of Parliament the project was folly. To overthrow the
  rights of corporations and of the Universities, and to attempt to bully
  the Church of England, after Elizabeth's fashion, at the very beginning
  of a pro-Catholic movement, was to provoke defeat.</p>

  <p>Parliament decided that James II. had "abdicated," when, deserted by
  Churchill, he fled to France, and William and Mary came to the throne at
  the express invitation of Parliament. The Revolution completed the work
  of the Long Parliament by defining the limits of monarchy, and
  establishing constitutional government. It was not&mdash;this Revolution,
  of 1688&mdash;the first time Parliament had sanctioned the deposing of
  the King of England and the appointment of his successor,<a
  name="footnotetag65" href="#footnote65"><sup>[65]</sup></a> but it was
  the last. Never again since the accession of William and Mary have the
  relations of the Crown and Parliament been strained to breaking point;
  never has the supremacy of Parliament been seriously threatened by the
  power of the throne.</p>

  <p>The full effects of the Revolution of 1688 were seen in the course of
  the next fifty years. Aristocracy, then mainly Whig, was triumphant, and
  under its rule, while large measures of civil and religious liberty were
  passed, the condition of the mass of labouring people was generally
  wretched in the extreme. The rule of the aristocracy saw England become a
  great power among the nations of the world, and the British Navy supreme
  over the navies of Europe; but it saw also an industrial population,
  untaught and uncared for, sink deeper and deeper into savagery and
  misery. For a time in the eighteenth century the farmer and the peasant
  were prosperous, but by the close of that century the small farmer was a
  ruined man, and with the labourer was carried by the industrial
  revolution into the town. The worst times for the English labourer in
  town and country since the Norman Conquest were the reign of Edward VI.
  and the first quarter of the nineteenth century.</p>

  <p>The development of our political institutions into their present form;
  the establishment of our Party system of government by Cabinet, and of
  the authority of the Prime Minister; the growth of the supreme power of
  the Commons, not only over the throne but over the Lords also: these were
  the work of the aristocracy of the eighteenth century, and were attained
  by steps so gradual as to be almost imperceptible. No idea of democracy
  guided the process; yet our modern democratic system is firm-rooted upon
  the principles and privileges of the Constitution as thus established.
  Social misery deepened, without check from the politicians; and the most
  enlightened statesmen of the Whig regime were very far from our present
  conceptions of the duties and possibilities of Parliament.</p>

<h4><font class="sc">Civil and Religious Liberty</font></h4>

  <p>James II. was tumbled from the throne for his vain attempt to
  establish toleration for Catholics and Nonconformists without consent of
  Parliament. Yet the Whig aristocracy which followed, while it did nothing
  for Catholics, laid broad principles of civil and religious liberty for
  democracy to build upon.<a name="footnotetag66"
  href="#footnote66"><sup>[66]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The Declaration of Right, presented by Parliament to William and Mary
  on their arrival in London, was turned into the Bill of Rights, and
  passed into law in 1689. It stands as the last of the great charters of
  political liberty, and states clearly both what is not permitted to the
  Crown, and what privileges are allowed to the people.</p>

  <p>Under the Bill of Rights the King was denied the power of suspending
  or dispensing, of levying money, or maintaining a standing army without
  consent of Parliament. The people were assured of the right of the
  subject to petition the Crown, and of the free election of
  representatives in Parliament, and of full and free debate in Parliament.
  Any profession of the Catholic religion, or marriage with a Catholic,
  disqualified from inheritance to or possession of the throne.</p>

  <p>So there was an end to the doctrine of the Divine Right of Kings, and
  four hundred non-juring clergymen&mdash;including half-a-dozen
  bishops&mdash;of the Church of England were deprived of their
  ecclesiastical appointments for refusing to accept the accomplished fact,
  and acknowledge William III. as the lawful King of England. By making
  William King, to the exclusion of the children of James II., Parliament
  destroyed for all future time in England the belief in the sacred
  character of kingship. The King was henceforth a part of the
  constitution, and came to the throne by authority of Parliament, on
  conditions laid down by Parliament.</p>

  <p>William resented the decision of Parliament not to allow the Crown a
  revenue for life, but to vote an annual supply; but the decision was
  adhered to, and has remained in force ever since. The Mutiny Act, passed
  the same year, placed the army under the control of Parliament, and the
  annual vote for military expenses has, in like manner, remained.</p>

  <p>The Toleration Act (1689) gave Nonconformists a legal right to worship
  in their own chapels, but expressly excluded Unitarians and Roman
  Catholics from this liberty. Life was made still harder for Roman
  Catholics in England by the Act of 1700, which forbade a Catholic priest,
  under penalty of imprisonment for life, to say mass, hear confessions, or
  exercise any clerical function, and denied the right of the Catholic
  laity to hold, buy or inherit property, or to have their children
  educated abroad. The objection to Roman Catholics was that their loyalty
  to the Pope was an allegiance to a "foreign" ruler which prevented their
  being good citizens at home. Against this prejudice it was useless to
  point to what had been done by Englishmen for their country, when all the
  land was Catholic, and all accepted the supremacy of the Pope. It was not
  till 1778 that the first Catholic Relief Bill was carried, a Bill that
  "shook the general prejudice against Catholics to the centre, and
  restored to them a thousand indescribable charities in the ordinary
  intercourse of social life which they had seldom experienced."</p>

  <p>The last Roman Catholic to die for conscience' sake was Oliver
  Plunket, Archbishop of Armagh, who was executed at Tyburn, when Charles
  II. was King, in 1681. After the Revolution, Nonconformists and Catholics
  were no longer hanged or tortured for declining the ministrations of the
  Established Church, but still were penalised in many lesser ways. But the
  spirit of the eighteenth century made for toleration, and the Whigs were
  as unostentatious in their own piety as they were indifferent to the
  piety of others.</p>

  <p>The killing of "witches," however, went on in Scotland and in England
  long after toleration had been secured for Nonconformists. As late as
  1712 a woman was executed for witchcraft in England.<a
  name="footnotetag67" href="#footnote67"><sup>[67]</sup></a></p>

<h4><font class="sc">Growth of Cabinet Rule</font></h4>

  <p>William III. began with a mixed ministry of Whigs and Tories, which
  included men like Danby and Godolphin, who had served under James II. But
  the fierce wrangling that went on over the war then being waged on the
  Continent was decidedly inconvenient, and by 1696 the Whigs had succeeded
  in driving all the Tories&mdash;who were against the war&mdash;out of
  office. Then for the first time a united ministry was in power, and from
  a Cabinet of men with common political opinions the next step was to
  secure that the Cabinet should represent the party with a majority in the
  House of Commons. Our present system of Cabinet rule, dependent on the
  will of the majority of the Commons, is found in full operation by the
  middle of the eighteenth century. The fact that William III., George I.,
  and George II. were all foreigners necessitated the King's ministers
  using considerable powers. But George III. was English, and effected a
  revival in the personal power of the King by his determination that the
  choice of ministers should rest with the Crown, and not with the House of
  Commons. He succeeded in breaking up the long Whig ascendancy, and so
  accustomed became the people to the King making and unmaking ministries,
  that on George IV.'s accession in 1820 it was fully expected the new King
  would turn out the Tories and put in Whigs. William IV. in 1835 did what
  no sovereign has done since&mdash;dissolved Parliament against the wish
  of the government.</p>

  <p>From 1696 to 1701 the Whigs were in office. Then on the death of
  William and the accession of Anne, Tory ministers were included in the
  government, and for seven years the Cabinet was composite again. But
  Marlborough and Godolphin found that if they were to remain in power it
  must be by the support of the Whigs, who had made the support of the war
  against France a party question; and from 1708 to 1710 the ministry was
  definitely Whig. By 1710 the war had ceased to be popular, and the
  general election of that year sent back a strong Tory majority to the
  House of Commons, with the result that the Tory leaders, Harley (Earl of
  Oxford) and Henry St. John (Bolingbroke) took office. The Tories fell on
  the death of Anne, because their plot to place James (generally called
  the Chevalier or the old Pretender), the Queen's half-brother, on the
  throne was defeated by the readiness of the Whig Dukes of Somerset and
  Argyll to proclaim George, Elector of Hanover, King of England. By the
  Act of Settlement, 1701, Parliament had decided that the Crown should
  pass from Anne to the heirs of Sophia, Electress of Hanover and daughter
  of James I.; and the fact that the Chevalier was a Catholic made his
  accession impossible according to law, and the policy of Bolingbroke
  highly treasonable.</p>

  <p>George I. could not speak English, and relied entirely on his Whig
  ministers. Bolingbroke fled to the Continent, but was permitted to return
  from exile nine years later. Oxford was impeached and sent to the Tower.
  The Whigs were left in triumph to rule the country for nearly fifty
  years&mdash;until the restiveness of George III. broke up their
  dominion&mdash;and for more than twenty years of that period Walpole was
  Prime Minister. Cabinet government&mdash;that is, government by a small
  body of men, agreed upon main questions of policy, and commanding the
  confidence of the majority of the House of Commons&mdash;was now in full
  swing, and in spite of the monarchist revival under George III., no King
  henceforth ever refused consent to a Bill passed by Parliament.</p>

  <p>The Whigs did nothing in those first sixty years of the eighteenth
  century to make the House of Commons more representative of the people.
  They were content to repeat the old cries of the Revolution, and to
  oppose all proposals of change. But they governed England without
  oppression, and Walpole's commercial and financial measures satisfied the
  trading classes and kept national credit sound.</p>

<h4><font class="sc">Walpole's Rule</font></h4>

  <p>Walpole remained in power from 1720 to 1742 by sheer
  corruption&mdash;there was no other way open to him. He laughed openly at
  all talk of honesty and purity, and his influence lowered the whole tone
  of public life.<a name="footnotetag68"
  href="#footnote68"><sup>[68]</sup></a> But he kept in touch with the
  middle classes, was honest personally, and had a large amount of tact and
  good sense. His power in the House of Commons endured because he
  understood the management of parliamentary affairs, and had a genius for
  discerning the men whose support he could buy, and whose support was
  valuable.</p>

  <p>George III. went to work in much the same way as Walpole had done, and
  only succeeded in breaking down the power of the Whig houses by using the
  same corrupt methods that Walpole had employed. The "King's friends," as
  they were called, acted independently of the party leaders, and in the
  pay of the King were the chief instrument of George III.'s will.</p>

<h4><font class="sc">The Change in the House of Lords</font></h4>

  <p>But George III. not only turned the Whigs out of office, he altered
  permanently the political complexion of the House of Lords. From the time
  of the Revolution of 1688 to the death of George II. in 1760, the Lords
  were Whiggish, and the majority of English nobles held Whig principles.
  They were, on the whole, men of better education than the average member
  of the House of Commons, who was in most cases a fox-hunting squire, of
  the Squire Western type. The House of Lords stood in the way of the
  Commons when, in the Tory reaction of 1701, the Commons proposed to
  impeach Somers, the Whig Chancellor, a high-minded and skilful lawyer,
  "courteous and complaisant, humane and benevolent," for his share in the
  Second Partition Treaty of 1699, and this was the beginning of a bitter
  contest between the Tory Commons and the Whig Lords. An attempt was made
  by the Commons to impeach Walpole on his fall in 1742, but the Lords
  threw out a Bill proposing to remit the penalties to which his prosecutor
  might be liable, and the King made Walpole a peer. George III., by an
  unsparing use of his prerogative, changed the character and politics of
  the Upper House. His creations were country gentlemen of sufficient
  wealth to own "pocket" boroughs in the House of Commons, and lawyers who
  supported the Royal prerogative.<a name="footnotetag69"
  href="#footnote69"><sup>[69]</sup></a></p>

  <p>From George III.'s time onward there has always been a standing and
  ever-increasing majority of Tory peers in the House of Lords. And while
  the actual number of members of the Upper House has been enlarged
  enormously, this majority has became enlarged out of all proportion.
  Liberal and Tory Prime Ministers were busy throughout the nineteenth
  century adding to the peerage&mdash;no less than 376 new peers were
  created between 1800 and 1907; but comparatively few Liberals retained
  their principles when they became peers, and two of the present chiefs of
  the Unionist Party in the House of Lords&mdash;Lords Lansdowne and
  Selborne&mdash;are the sons of eminent Liberals.</p>

  <p>So it has come about that while the House of Commons has been steadily
  opening its doors to men of all ranks and classes, and in our time has
  become increasingly democratic in character, the House of Lords, confined
  in the main to men of wealth and social importance, has become an
  enormous assembly of undistinguished persons, where only a small minority
  are active politicians, and of this minority at least three-fourths are
  Conservatives.</p>

  <p>This change in the House of Lords began, as we have seen, in the reign
  of George III., when the Whig ascendancy in Parliament had passed. But
  the Whigs did nothing during their long lease of power to bring democracy
  nearer, and were entirely contemptuous of popular aspirations. At the
  very time when the democratic idea was the theme of philosophers, and was
  to be seen expressed in the constitution of the revolted American
  colonies, and in the French Revolution, England remained under an
  aristocracy, governed first by Whigs, and then by Tories. It is true
  democracy was not without its spokesmen in England in the eighteenth
  century, but there was no popular movement in politics to stir the masses
  of the people, as the preaching of the Methodists stirred their hearts
  for religion. Democratic ideas were as remote from popular discussion in
  the eighteenth century as they had been made familiar by Lilburne for a
  brief season in the seventeenth century.</p>

<h4>"<font class="sc">Wilkes and Liberty</font>"</h4>

  <p>A word must be said about John Wilkes, a man of disreputable character
  and considerable ability, who for some ten
  years&mdash;1763-73&mdash;contended for the rights of electors against
  the Whig Government. The battle began when George Grenville, the Whig
  Prime Minister, had Wilkes arrested on a general warrant for an article
  attacking the King's Speech in No. 45 of the <i>North Briton</i>, a
  scurrilous newspaper which belonged to Wilkes. Chief Justice Pratt
  declared the arrest illegal on the ground that the warrant was bad, and
  that Wilkes, being at the time M.P. for Aylesbury, enjoyed the privilege
  of Parliament. A jury awarded Wilkes heavy damages against the Government
  for false imprisonment, and the result of the trial made Wilkes a popular
  hero. Then, in 1764, the Government brought a new charge of blasphemy and
  libel, and Wilkes, expelled from the House of Commons, and condemned by
  the King's Bench, fled to France, and was promptly declared an outlaw. He
  returned, however, a year or two later, and while in prison was elected
  M.P. for Middlesex. The House of Commons, led by the Government, set the
  election aside, and riots for "Wilkes and Liberty" broke out in London.
  The question was: Had the House of Commons a right to exclude a member
  duly elected for a constituency?&mdash;the same question that was raised
  over Charles Bradlaugh, a man of very different character, in the
  Parliament of 1880. Again and again in 1768 and 1769 Wilkes was
  re-elected for Middlesex, only to be expelled, and finally the House
  decided that Wilkes' opponent, Colonel Luttrell, was to sit, although
  Luttrell was manifestly not chosen by the majority of electors. The
  citizens of London replied to this by choosing Wilkes for Sheriff and
  Alderman in 1770, and by making him Lord Mayor four years later. The
  Government gave up the contest at last, and Wilkes was allowed to take
  his seat. Besides vindicating the right of constituencies against the
  claim of Parliament to exclude undesirable persons, Wilkes did a good
  deal towards securing that right of Parliamentary debating which was
  practically admitted after 1771.</p>

  <p>But the "Wilkes and Liberty" movement was no more than a popular
  enthusiasm of the London mob for an enemy of the Government, and a
  determination of London citizens and Middlesex electors not to be
  brow-beaten by the Government. Wilkes himself always denied that he was a
  "Wilkesite," and he had no following in the country or in Parliament.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTERVI">CHAPTER VI</a></h3>

<h3>THE RISE OF THE DEMOCRATIC IDEA</h3>

<h4><font class="sc">The Witness of the Middle Ages</font></h4>

  <p>The idea of constitutional government has its witnesses in the Middle
  Ages, democratic theories are common in the sixteenth and seventeenth
  centuries, but it is not till the eighteenth century that France, aflame
  to realise a political ideal, proves that democracy has passed from the
  books of schoolmen and philosophers, and is to be put in practice by a
  nation in arms.</p>

  <p>In the thirteenth century the friars rallied to Simon of Montfort and
  preached, not democracy, but constitutional liberty.<a
  name="footnotetag70" href="#footnote70"><sup>[70]</sup></a> Thomas
  Aquinas, the great Dominican doctor, became the chief exponent of
  political theory, and maintained that sovereignty expressed in
  legislative power should be exercised for the common good, and that a
  mixed government of monarch, nobles, and people, with the Pope as a final
  Court of Appeal, would best attain that end.<a name="footnotetag71"
  href="#footnote71"><sup>[71]</sup></a></p>

  <p>A hundred years later, John Ball and his fellow agitators preached a
  gospel of social equality that inspired the Peasant Revolt. But communism
  was the goal of the peasant leaders in 1381, and freedom from actual
  oppression the desire of their followers. No conception of political
  democracy can be found in the speeches and demands of Wat Tyler.</p>

  <p>In the sixteenth century Robert Ket in Norfolk renewed the old cries
  of social revolution, and roused the countryside to stop the enclosures
  by armed revolt. And again the popular rising is an agrarian war to end
  intolerable conditions, not a movement for popular government.</p>

<h4><font class="sc">The "Social Contract" Theory</font></h4>

  <p>The theory of a pact or contract between the Government and the people
  became the favourite assumption of political writers from the sixteenth
  century onward, and it was this theory that Rousseau popularised in his
  "Social Contract," the theory, too, which triumphed for a season in the
  French Revolution.</p>

  <p>The theory is, of course, pure assumption, without any basis in
  history, and resting on no foundation of fact. It assumes that primitive
  man was born with enlightened views on civil government, and that for the
  greater well-being of his tribe or nation he deposited the sovereign
  authority which belonged to himself, in a prince or king&mdash;or in some
  other form of executive government&mdash;retaining the right to withdraw
  his allegiance from the government if the authority is abused, and the
  contract which conferred sovereignty violated. It was not maintained that
  the contract was an actually written document; it was supposed to be a
  tacit agreement. The whole theory seems to have sprung from the study of
  Roman law and the constitutions of Athens and Sparta. Nothing was known
  of primitive man or of the beginnings of civilisation till the nineteenth
  century. The Bible and the classical literature of Greece and Rome are
  all concerned with civilised, not primitive, man, and with slaves and
  "heathens" who are accounted less than men. The "sovereign people" of
  Athens and Sparta became the model of later republican writers, while the
  choosing of a king by the Israelites recorded in the Old Testament
  sanctioned the idea, for early Protestant writers, that sovereignty was
  originally in the people.</p>

  <p>The Huguenot Languet, in his <i>Vindiciae contra Tyrannos</i> (1579),
  maintained on scriptural grounds that kingly power was derived from the
  will of the people, and that the violation by the king of the mutual
  compact of king and people to observe the laws absolved the people from
  all allegiance.<a name="footnotetag72"
  href="#footnote72"><sup>[72]</sup></a> The Jesuit writers, Bellarmine and
  Mariana, argued for the sovereignty of the people as the basis of kingly
  rule; and when the English divines of the Established Church were
  upholding the doctrine of the divine right of kings, the Spanish Jesuit,
  Suarez, was amongst those who attacked that doctrine, quoting a great
  body of legal opinion in support of the contention that "the prince has
  that power of law giving which the people have given him." Suarez, too,
  insists that all men are born equal, and that "no one has a political
  jurisdiction over another." Milton, in his "Tenure of Kings and
  Magistrates" (1649), had taken a similar line: the people had vested in
  kings and magistrates the authority and power of self-defence and
  preservation. "The power of kings and magistrates is nothing else but
  what is only derivative, transferred, and committed to them in trust from
  the people to the common good of all, in whom the power yet remains
  fundamentally, and cannot be taken from them without a violation of their
  natural birthright." Hooker, fifty years earlier (1592-3), in his
  "Ecclesiastical Polity," Book I., had affirmed the sovereignty or
  legislative power of the people as the ultimate authority, and had also
  declared for an original social contract, "all public regiment of what
  kind soever seemeth evidently to have risen from deliberate advice,
  consultation, and composition between men, judging it convenient and
  behoveful." Hobbes made the social contract a justification for Royal
  absolutism, and Locke, with a Whig ideal of constitutional government,
  enlarged on the right of a people to change its form of government, and
  justified the Revolution of 1688. The writings of Hobbes and Locke have
  had a lasting influence, and Locke is really the source of the democratic
  stream of the eighteenth century. It rises in Locke to become the torrent
  of the French Revolution.</p>

  <p>But Huguenots and Jesuits, Hooker and Milton&mdash;what influence had
  their writings on the mass of English people? None whatever, as far as we
  can see. Milton could write of "the power" of "the people" as a "natural
  birthright," but the power was plainly in Cromwell's army, and "the
  people" had no means of expression concerning its will, and no
  opportunity for the assertion of sovereignty. Lilburne and the Levellers
  held that democracy could be set up on the ruins of Charles I.'s
  Government, and the sovereignty of the people become a fact; and with a
  ready political instinct Lilburne proposed the election of popular
  representatives on a democratic franchise. Cromwell rejected all
  Lilburne's proposals; for him affairs of State were too serious for
  experiments in democracy; and Lilburne himself was cast into prison by
  the Commonwealth Government. Lilburne's pamphlets were exceedingly
  numerous, and his popularity, in London particularly, enormous. He was
  the voice of the unrepresented, powerless citizens in whom the republican
  theorists saw the centre of authority. The one effort to persuade the
  Commonwealth Republic to give power to the people was made by John
  Lilburne, and it was defeated. The Whig theory that an aristocratic House
  of Commons, elected by a handful of people, and mainly at the dictation
  of the landowners, was "the People," triumphed. The bulk of the English
  people were left out of all account in the political struggles of Whigs
  and Tories, and democracy was not dreamed of till America was free and
  France a republic. The industrial revolution compelled the reform of the
  British House of Commons, and democracy has slowly superseded
  aristocracy, not from any enthusiasm for the "sovereign people," but from
  the traditional belief that representative government means the rule of
  the people.</p>

  <p>Precedent, not theory, has been the argument for democracy in
  England.</p>

<h4><font class="sc">Thomas Hobbes</font> (1588-1679)</h4>

  <p>The writings of Hobbes are important, because they state the case for
  absolute rule, or "a strong government," as we call it to-day. Hobbes was
  frankly rationalist and secular. Holding the great end of government to
  be happiness, he made out that natural man lived in savage ill-will with
  his fellows. To secure some sort of decency and safety men combined
  together and surrendered all natural rights to a sovereign&mdash;either
  one man, or an assembly of men&mdash;and in return civil rights were
  guaranteed. But the sovereignty once established was supreme, and to
  injure it was to injure oneself, since it was composed of "every
  particular man." The sovereign power was unlimited, and was not to be
  questioned. Whether monarchy, aristocracy, or democracy was the form of
  government was unimportant, though Hobbes preferred monarchy, because
  popular assemblies were unstable and apt to need dictators. Civil laws
  were the standard of right and wrong, and obedience to autocracy was
  better than the resistance which led to civil war or anarchy&mdash;the
  very things that induced men to establish sovereignty. Only when the
  safety of the state was threatened was rebellion justifiable.</p>

  <p>At bottom, the objection to the theories of Hobbes is the same
  objection that must be taken to the theories of Locke and Rousseau. All
  these writers assume not only the fiction of a social contract, but a
  <i>static</i> view of society. Society is the result of growth: it is not
  a fixed and settled community. Mankind proceeds experimentally in forms
  of government. To Hobbes and his followers, security of life and property
  was the one essential thing for mankind&mdash;disorder and social
  insecurity the things to be prevented at all cost. Now, this might be all
  very well but for evolution. Mankind cannot rest quietly under the
  strongest and most stable government in the world. It will insist on
  learning new tricks, on thinking new thoughts, and if it is not allowed
  to teach itself fresh habits, it will break out in revolt, and either the
  government will be broken or the subjects will wither away under the rule
  of repression.</p>

  <p>Hobbes may be quoted as a supporter of the rule of the Stuarts, and
  equally of the rule of Cromwell. Every kind of strong tyranny may be
  defended by his principles.</p>

  <p>In the nineteenth century Carlyle was the finest exponent of "strong"
  government, and generally the leaders of the Tory party have been its
  advocates, particularly in the attitude to be taken towards subject
  races.</p>

<h4><font class="sc">John Locke</font> (1632-1704)</h4>

  <p>Locke, setting out to vindicate the Whig Revolution of 1688, rejects
  Hobbes' view of the savagery of primitive man, and invents "a state of
  peace, goodwill, mutual assistance and preservation"&mdash;equally, as we
  know to-day, far from the truth. Locke's primitive men have a natural
  right to personal property&mdash;"as much land as a man tills, plants,
  improves, cultivates, and can use the product of, so much is his
  property"&mdash;but they are as worried and as fearful as Hobbes'
  savages. So they, too, renounce their natural rights in favour of civil
  liberty, and are happy when they have got "a standing rule to live by,
  common to every one of that society, and made by the legislative power
  erected on it."</p>

  <p>According to Hobbes, once having set up a government, there was no
  possible justification for changing it&mdash;save national peril; and a
  bad government was to be obeyed rather than the danger of civil war
  incurred.</p>

  <p>But Locke never allows the government to be more than the trustee of
  the people who placed it in power. It rules by consent of the community,
  and may be removed or altered when it violates its trust. Hobbes saw in
  the break-up of a particular government the dissolution of society. Locke
  made a great advance on this, for he saw that a change of government
  could be accomplished without any very serious disturbance in the order
  of society or the peace of a nation. Hobbes did not believe that the
  people could be trusted to effect a change of government, while Locke had
  to justify the change which had just taken place in 1688.</p>

  <p>Only when we have dropped all Locke's theories of primitive man's
  happiness, and the social-contract fiction, does the real value of his
  democratic teaching become clear, and the lasting influence of his work
  become visible.</p>

  <p>Mankind is compelled to adopt some form of government if it is to
  sleep at nights without fear of being murdered in its bed, or if it
  wishes to have its letters delivered by the postman in the morning. As
  the only purpose of government is to secure mutual protection, mankind
  must obey this government, or the purpose for which government exists
  will be defeated. But the powers of government must be strictly limited
  if this necessary consent of the governed is to continue, and if the
  government has ceased to retain the confidence that gives consent, then
  its form may be changed to some more appropriate shape.</p>

  <p>Now all this theory of Locke's has proved to be true in the progress
  of modern democracy. It was pointed out that the danger of his
  doctrine&mdash;that a nation had the right to choose its form of
  government, and to change or adapt its constitution&mdash;lay in the
  sanction it gave to revolution; but Locke answered that the natural
  inertia of man was a safeguard against frequent and violent political
  changes, and as far as England was concerned Locke was right. The average
  Englishman grumbles, but only under great provocation is he moved to
  violent political activity. As a nation, we have acknowledged the right
  of the majority to make the political changes that have brought in
  democracy, and we have accepted the changes loyally. Occasionally, since
  Locke, the delay of the government in carrying out the wishes of the
  majority has induced impatience, but, generally, the principle has been
  acted upon that government is carried on with the consent of the
  governed, and that the Parliamentary party which has received the largest
  number of votes has the authority from the people to choose its ministry,
  and to make laws that all must obey.</p>

  <p>The power of the people is demonstrated by the free election of
  members of Parliament, and, therefore, democracy requires that its
  authority be obeyed by all who are represented in Parliament. There is no
  social contract between the voter and the government; but there is a
  general feeling that it is not so much participation in politics as the
  quiet enjoyment of the privileges of citizenship that obliges submission
  to the laws. The extension of the franchise was necessary whenever a body
  of people excluded from the electorate was conscious of being
  unrepresented and desired representation. Otherwise the consent of the
  voteless governed was obviously non-existent, and government was carried
  on in defiance of the absence of that consent.</p>

  <p>It is not Locke's theories that have guided politically the great
  masses of the people, for Locke's writings have had no very considerable
  popularity in England. But it has happened that these theories have
  influenced the conduct of statesmen, and with reason, since they offer an
  explanation of political progress, and constrain politicians to act,
  experimentally indeed, but with some reasonable anticipation of safety to
  the nation. British statesmen and politicians have made no parade of
  Locke's opinions; they have done nothing to incur the charge of
  "theorist," but the influence of Locke can be seen all the
  same&mdash;chiefly in the loyal acceptance of political change, in the
  refusal to be shocked or alarmed at a "leap in the dark," and by a
  willingness to adjust the machinery of government to the needs of the
  time. In England Locke's influence has been less dynamic than static; it
  has helped us to preserve a moderation in politics; to be content with
  piecemeal legislation, because to attempt too much might be to alienate
  the sympathies of the majority; to keep our political eye, so to speak,
  on the ebb and flow of public opinion&mdash;since it is public opinion
  that is the final court of appeal; to tolerate abuses until it is quite
  plain a great number of people are anxious to have the abuse removed; and
  above all to settle down in easy contentment under political defeat, and
  make the best of accomplished reforms, not because we like them, but
  because a Parliamentary majority has decreed them.</p>

  <p>For England, in fact, the essence of Locke's teaching has helped to
  produce a deference almost servile to political majorities and to public
  opinion, a reluctance to make any reform until public opinion has
  pronounced loudly and often in favour of reform, and an emphatic
  assurance that every reform enacted by Parliament is the unmistakable
  expression of the will of the people. Locke has discouraged us from hasty
  legislation and from political panics.</p>

<h4><font class="sc">Rousseau and the French Revolution</font></h4>

  <p>Locke's influence in France and in America has been altogether
  different. Voltaire, Rousseau, and Diderot were all students and admirers
  of Locke, and his political theories were at the base of Rousseau's
  "Social Contract." A return to nature, a harking back to an imaginary
  primitive happiness of mankind, the glorification of an ideal of
  simplicity and innocence,&mdash;supposed to have been the ideal of early
  politics&mdash;the restoration of a popular sovereignty built up on
  natural rights alleged to have been lost: these were the articles of
  faith Rousseau preached with passionate conviction in his "Discourses"
  and in the "Social Contract." Individual man was born naturally "free,"
  and had become debased and enslaved by laws and civilisation. "Man is
  born free, and everywhere he is in chains," is the opening sentence of
  the "Social Contract." This liberty and equality of primitive man was
  acclaimed as a law of nature by eighteenth century writers in France, and
  to some extent in England too. Pope could write, "The state of nature was
  the reign of God." Instead of a forward movement the business of man was
  to recover the lost happiness of the childhood of the world, to bring
  back a golden age of liberty and equality. Locke's "state of peace,
  goodwill, mutual assistance, and preservation" is to be the desire of
  nations, and with wistful yearning Rousseau's disciples gazed on the
  picture painted by their master.</p>

  <p>It was all false, all a fiction, all mischievous and misleading, this
  doctrine of a return to an ideal happiness of the past, and it was the
  most worthless portion of Locke's work. To-day it is easy for us to say
  this, when we have learnt something of the struggle for existence in
  nature, something of the habits and customs of primitive man, and
  something of man's upward growth. But Locke and Rousseau were born before
  our limited knowledge of the history of man and his institutions had been
  learnt; before science, with patient research, had revealed a few
  incidents in the long story of man's ascent. Even the history of Greece
  and Rome, as Rousseau read it, was hopelessly inaccurate and incomplete.
  Therefore, while we can see the fallacy in all the eighteenth century
  teaching concerning the natural happiness of uncivilised man, we must at
  the same time remember it as a doctrine belonging to a pre-scientific
  era. The excuse in France, too, for its popularity was great.
  Civilisation weighed heavily on the nation. The whole country groaned
  under a misrule, and commerce and agriculture were crippled by the system
  of taxation. It seemed that France was impoverished to maintain a
  civilisation that only a few, and they not the most useful members of the
  community, could enjoy.</p>

  <p>How mankind had passed from primitive freedom to civilised slavery
  neither Locke nor Rousseau inquired. "Man is born free, and everywhere he
  is in chains," cries Rousseau, in sublime disregard of facts. For man was
  not born free in the ancient republics of Greece and Rome that Rousseau
  revered; children were not born free in his day any more than they are in
  ours; and any assembly or community of people necessarily involves mutual
  consideration and forbearance which are at once restrictive.</p>

  <p>The truth is, of course, that man is not born free, but is born with
  free will to work out political freedom or to consent to servitude. He is
  not born with "natural" political rights, but born to acquire by law
  political rights.</p>

  <p>The fiction of primitive man's happiness and of the natural goodness
  and freedom of man did little harm in England, for Locke was not a
  popular author, and Wesley's religious revival in the eighteenth century
  laid awful stress on man's imperfections. The sovereign people ruled in
  an unreformed House of Commons, and the "contract" theory was exhibited
  by ministers holding office on the strength of a majority in the
  Commons.</p>

  <p>Rousseau's writings depicted, with a clearness that fascinated the
  reader, the contrast between the ideal state that man had lost and the
  present condition of society with its miseries and corruption; and by its
  explanation of the doctrines of a contract and the sovereignty of the
  people, suggested the way to end these miseries and corruptions. The
  "Social Contract" became the text-book of the men who made the French
  Revolution, and if the success of the Revolution is due to the teaching
  of Rousseau more than to that of any other French philosopher, the crimes
  and mistakes of the Revolution are directly to be traced to his
  influence, and this in spite of Rousseau's deprecation of violence.<a
  name="footnotetag73" href="#footnote73"><sup>[73]</sup></a></p>

  <p>As there is a certain tendency in England to-day to attempt the
  resuscitation of Rousseau's theories of popular sovereignty and the
  natural rights of man, and as so distinguished a writer as Mr. Hilaire
  Belloc is at pains to invite the English working class to seek
  illumination from Rousseau and to proceed to democracy guided by the
  speculative political doctrines of the eighteenth century rather than on
  the tried experimental lines of representative government and an extended
  franchise, it is necessary to devote to Rousseau and his "Social
  Contract" more space than the subject deserves.</p>

  <p>The "Social Contract" is full of inaccuracies in its references to
  history; it is often self-contradictory, and it has not even the merit of
  originality. From Hobbes Rousseau borrowed the notion of authority in the
  State; from Locke the seat of this authority; the nature of the original
  pact and of citizenship from Spinoza; from the Huguenot Languet the
  doctrine of fraternity; and from Althusius the doctrine of the
  inalienability of citizenship. Where Locke was content to maintain that
  the people collectively had the right to change the form of government,
  Rousseau would give the community continual exercise in sovereignty,
  while voting and representation are signs of democratic decadence in
  Rousseau's eyes. The sovereign people governing, not through elected
  representatives but by public meeting, has only been found possible in
  small slave-ridden states.</p>

  <p>At the Revolution France had to elect its deputies. But the theory of
  the sovereignty of the people has over and over again, in France, upset
  the Government, and destroyed the authority of the deputies. In England
  we accept the rule of Parliament, and are satisfied that the election of
  representatives by an enfranchised people is the most satisfactory form
  of democracy, though we retain a healthy instinct of criticism of the
  Government in power. In France has happened what Locke's critics
  foretold: the sovereign people never wholeheartedly delegates its powers
  to its deputies, and indulges in revolution when impatient of government.
  During the Revolution the passionate clamour of the sovereign people
  overpowered the votes and voices of elected representatives, and
  revolution and reaction were the rule in France from 1793 to 1871.</p>

  <p>We may be frankly against the Government all the time in England; we
  may resist it actively and passively, for the purpose of calling
  attention to some political grievance, some disability that needs
  removal. But we never forget that it is the Government, or believe that
  it can be overturned save by the votes of the electorate. At the time of
  the European revolutions of 1848, when crowns were falling, and ministers
  flying before the rage of the sovereign people, Chartism never seriously
  threatened the stability of the British Government, and its great
  demonstrations were no real menace to the existing order. Nothing seems
  able to shake the British confidence in its elected representatives, and
  in the Government that is supported by a majority of those
  representatives. We have never accepted the gospel of Jean Jacques
  Rousseau; Priestley and Price are almost the only names that can be
  mentioned as disciples of Rousseau before the advent of Mr. H.
  Belloc.</p>

  <p>France, still following Rousseau, does not associate political
  sovereignty with representation as England does. It never invests the
  doings of its Cabinet with a sacred importance, and it readily transfers
  the reins of government from Ministry to Ministry. France has submitted
  to the sovereignty of an Emperor and to the rule of kings since the great
  Revolution, and though its Republic is now forty years old, and at
  present there are no signs of dictatorship on the horizon, the Government
  of the Republic is never safe from a revolutionary rising of the
  sovereign people, and only by the strength of its army has revolution
  been kept at bay. If Louis XVI. had possessed the army of modern France
  he too might have kept the revolution at bay. All this revolution and
  reaction, disbelief in the authority of representative government, and
  lively conviction that sovereignty is with the citizens, and must be
  asserted from time to time&mdash;to the confusion of deputies and
  delegates&mdash;is Rousseau's work, the reaping of the harvest sown by
  the "Social Contract." Let us sum up the character of Rousseau's work,
  and then leave him and his doctrines for ever behind us.</p>

  <p>"Rousseau's scheme is that of a doctrinaire who is unconscious of the
  infinite variety and complexity of life, and its apparent simplicity is
  mainly due to his inability to realise and appreciate the difficulties of
  his task. He evinced no insight into the political complications of his
  time; and his total ignorance of affairs, together with his contempt for
  civilised life, prevented him from framing a theory of any practical
  utility. Indeed, the disastrous attempt of the Jacobins to apply his
  principles proved how valueless and impracticable most of his doctrines
  were. He never attempted to trace social and political evils to their
  causes, in order to suggest suitable modifications of existing
  conditions. He could not see how impossible it was to sweep away all
  institutions and impose a wholly new social order irrespective of the
  natures, faculties, and desires of those whom he wished to benefit; on
  the contrary, he exaggerates the passivity and plasticity of men and
  circumstances, and dreams that his model legislator, who apparently is to
  initiate the new society, will be able to repress all anti-social
  feelings. He aims at order and symmetry, oblivious that human nature does
  not easily and rapidly bend to such treatment. It is his inability to
  discover the true mode of investigation that accounts for much of
  Rousseau's sophistry. His truisms and verbal propositions, his dogmatic
  assertions and unreal demonstrations, savour more of theology than of
  political science, while his quasi-mathematical method of reasoning from
  abstract formulæ, assumed to be axiomatic, gives a deceptive air of
  exactness and cogency which is apt to be mistaken for sound logic. He
  supports glaring paradoxes with an array of ingenious arguments, and with
  fatal facility and apparent precision he deduces from his unfounded
  premises a series of inconsequent conclusions, which he regards as
  authoritative and universally applicable. At times he becomes less rigid,
  as when (under the influence of Montesquieu) he studies the relations
  between the physical constitution of a nation, its territory, its
  customs, its form of government, and its deep-rooted opinions, or avows
  that there has been too much dispute about the forms of government. But
  such considerations are not prominent. In certain cases his
  inconsistencies may be due to re-handling, but he is said to have
  observed that those who boasted of understanding the whole contract were
  more clever than he."<a name="footnotetag74"
  href="#footnote74"><sup>[74]</sup></a></p>

  <p>This may sound very severe, but it is entirely just. The "Social
  Contract" consists of four books: (1) The founding of the civilized state
  by a social pact. (2) The theory of the sovereignty of the people. (3)
  and (4). The different forms of government; the indestructible character
  of the general will of the community; and civil religion.</p>

  <p>The whole work teems with generalisations, mostly ill-founded, and the
  details are not in agreement. The one thing of permanent value is the
  conception that the State represents the "general will" of the community.
  How that "general will" finds expression and gets its way is of great
  importance to democracy. Even more important is the nature of that
  "general will." Individualist as Rousseau was in his views about personal
  property (following Locke in an apparent ideal of peasant
  proprietorship), he insisted on the subjection of personal rights to the
  safety of the Commonwealth.</p>

<h4><font class="sc">American Independence</font></h4>

  <p>The resistance of the American colonies to the British Government did
  not commence with any spirit of independence. The tea incident at Boston
  took place in 1773, and it was not till three years later that the
  Declaration of Independence was drawn up. The Whig principles of 1688 are
  at the foundation of American liberties, and Locke's influence is to be
  seen both in the Declaration of Independence and in the American
  constitution. The colonists from the first had in many states a
  Puritanism that was hostile to the prerogatives of governors, and appeals
  to the British Government against the misuse of the prerogative were
  generally successful. The colonists wanted no more, and no less, than the
  constitutional rights enjoyed by Englishmen in Great Britain, and while
  the Whigs were in power these rights were fairly secure. George III.,
  attempting a reversion to monarchist rule, drove the colonists to war and
  to seek independence; with the aid of France this independence was
  won.</p>

  <p>If the French officers who assisted the Americans brought the
  doctrines of Rousseau to the revolted colonists, which is possible, it is
  quite certain that the establishment of the American Republic, and the
  principles of La Fayette and Paine, who had fought in the American War,
  were not without effect in France.</p>

  <p>The American Constitution was the work of men who believed in
  democratic government as Locke had defined it, and America has been the
  biggest experiment in democracy the world has seen. The fact that the
  President and his Cabinet are not members of Congress makes the great
  distinction between the British and American Constitution. The College of
  Electors is elected only to elect the President; that done, its work is
  over. Congress, consisting of members elected from each state, and the
  Senate, consisting of representatives from each state, need not contain a
  majority of the President's party, and the President is in no way
  responsible to Congress as the British Prime Minister is to the House of
  Commons. The relation of the State Governments to the Federal Government
  has presented the chief difficulty to democracy in America.</p>

  <p>The Whigs, or Republicans, as they came to be called, stood for a
  strong Federal Government; the Democrats were jealous for the rights of
  State Governments. The issue was not decided till the Civil War of
  1861-1865, when the southern slave-holding States, seeing slavery
  threatened, announced their secession from the United States. Abraham
  Lincoln, the newly-elected President, declared that the Government could
  not allow secession, and insisted that the war was to save the union.
  Slavery was abolished and the Union saved by the defeat of the
  Secessionists; but for a time the fortunes of the Union were more
  desperate than they had been at any time since the Declaration of
  Independence.</p>

  <p>Hamilton was the real founder of the Republican party, as Jefferson
  was of the Democrats. Both these men were prominent in the making of the
  American Constitution in 1787, and Jefferson was the responsible author
  of the Declaration of Independence. But Franklin and Paine made large
  contributions to the democratic independence of America.</p>

<h4><font class="sc">Thomas Paine</font> (1737-1809)</h4>

  <p>Edmund Randolph, the first Attorney-General of the United States, was
  on Washington's staff at the beginning of the War, and he ascribed
  independence in the first place to George III., but next to "Thomas
  Paine, an Englishman by birth."<a name="footnotetag75"
  href="#footnote75"><sup>[75]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Paine's later controversies with theological opponents have obscured
  his very considerable services to American Independence, to political
  democracy in England, and to constitutional government in the French
  Revolution; and as mankind is generally, and naturally, more interested
  in religion than in politics, Paine is remembered rather as an
  "infidel"&mdash;though he was a strong theist&mdash;than as a gifted
  writer on behalf of democracy and a political reformer of original
  powers.</p>

  <p>Paine&mdash;who came of a Suffolk Quaker family&mdash;reached America
  in 1774, on the very threshold of the war. His Quaker principles made him
  attack negro slavery on his arrival, and he endeavoured, without success,
  to get an anti-slavery clause inserted in the "Declaration of
  Independence." He served in the American ranks during the war, and was
  the friend of Washington, who recognised the value of his writings. For
  Paine's "Common Sense" pamphlet and his publication, "The Crisis," had
  enormous circulation, and were of the greatest value in keeping the
  spirit of independence alive in the dark years of the war. They were
  fiercely Republican; and though they were not entirely free from
  contemporary notions of government established on the ruins of a lost
  innocence, they struck a valiant note of self-reliance, and emphasised
  the importance of the average honest man. "Time makes more converts than
  reason," wrote Paine. Of monarchy he could say, "The fate of Charles I.
  hath only made kings more subtle&mdash;not more just"; and, "Of more
  worth is one honest man to society, and in the sight of God, than all the
  crowned ruffians that ever lived."</p>

  <p>Paine was in England in 1787, busy with scientific inventions, popular
  in Whig circles and respected. The fall of the Bastille won his applause,
  as it did the applause of Fox and the Whigs, but it was not till the
  publication of Burke's "Reflections on the Revolution in France," in
  1790, that Paine again took up his pen on behalf of democracy.</p>

  <p>Burke had been the hero of Paine and the Americans in the War of
  Independence, and his speeches and writings had justified the republic.
  And now it was the political philosophy of Hobbes that Burke seemed to be
  contending for when he insisted that the English people were bound for
  ever to royalty by the act of allegiance to William III.</p>

  <p>Paine replied to Burke the following year with the "Rights of Man"
  which he wrote in a country inn, the "Angel," at Islington. It was not so
  much to demolish Burke as to give the English nation a constitution that
  Paine desired; for it seemed to the author of "Common Sense" that,
  America having renounced monarchy and set up a republican form of
  government, safely guarded by a written constitution, England must be
  anxious to do the same thing, and was only in need of a constitution.</p>

  <p>The flamboyant rhetoric of the American Declaration of
  Independence&mdash;"We hold these truths to be self-evident&mdash;that
  all men are created equal; that they are endowed by the Creator with
  inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit
  of happiness"&mdash;was not the sort of language that appealed to English
  Whigs (America itself cheerfully admitted the falseness of the statement
  by keeping the negro in slavery), and the glittering generalities of the
  "Rights of Man" made no impression on the Whig leaders in Parliament.
  Paine was back in the old regions of a social contract, and of a popular
  sovereignty antecedent to government. It was all beside the mark, this
  talk of a popular right inherent in the nation, a right that gave the
  power to make constitutional changes not <i>through</i> elected
  representatives in Parliament, but by a general convention. Parliament in
  the sight of the Whigs was the sovereign assembly holding its authority
  from the people, and only by a majority in the House of Commons could the
  people express its will. What made the "Rights of Man" popular with the
  English democrats of the "Constitutional Society" and the sympathisers
  with the French Revolution was not so much the old pre-historic popular
  "sovereignty" fiction&mdash;though it is true that there were many
  Englishmen, of whom Godwin was one, who could see no hope of Parliament
  reforming itself or of granting any measure of enfranchisement to the
  people, and therefore were willing to fall back on any theory for
  compelling Parliament to move towards a more liberal
  constitution&mdash;as the programme of practical reforms that was
  unfolded in its pages and the honest defence of the proceedings in Paris.
  That Parliament had no right to bind posterity, as Burke maintained, and
  that if the revolution of 1688 was authoritative, why should a revolution
  in 1788 be less authoritative? were matters of less interest than the
  clear statement of events in France, and the proposals for a democratic
  constitution in England and for social reform. Fifty thousand copies of
  the "Rights of Man" were quickly sold, and it obtained a large number of
  readers in America, and was translated into French. The total sales were
  estimated at 200,000 in 1793. Paine followed it up with Part II. while he
  was an elected member of the National Convention in Paris, and in 1792,
  when a cheap edition of the "Rights of Man" was issued, its author was
  tried for high treason, and in his absence convicted and outlawed.</p>

  <p>Part I. of the "Rights of Man," while relying on the popular
  "sovereignty" fiction for getting a national convention, contained a
  careful definition of representative government. It showed that
  government by democracy&mdash;i.e. by popular meeting, suitable enough
  for small and primitive societies&mdash;must degenerate into hopeless
  confusion in a large population; that monarchy and aristocracy which
  sprang from the political confusion of the people must degenerate into
  incapacity. A representative government was the control of a nation by
  persons elected by the whole nation, and the Rights of Man were the
  rights of all to this representation.</p>

  <p>As a nation we have never admitted any "natural" political rights to
  man, but we have steadily insisted on the constitutional right of
  representation in Parliament to those who possess a fixed abode and
  contribute by taxation to the national revenue.</p>

  <p>Paine attacked all hereditary authority and all titles, but approved a
  double chamber for Parliament. He claimed that the whole nation ought to
  decide on the question of war with a foreign country, and urged that no
  member of Parliament should be a government pensioner.</p>

  <p>In Part II. there is a confident announcement that "monarchy and
  aristocracy will not continue seven years longer in any of the
  enlightened countries of Europe," so sure was Paine that civilised
  mankind would hasten to follow the examples of France and America, and
  summon national conventions for the making of republican constitutions.
  As the old form of government had been hereditary, the new form was to be
  elective and representative. The money hitherto spent on the Crown was to
  be devoted to a national system of elementary education&mdash;all
  children remaining at school till the age of 14&mdash;and to old-age
  pensions for all over 60. It is in these financial proposals and the
  suggested social reforms that Paine is seen as a pioneer of democracy. A
  progressive income tax is included in this Part II., the tax to be
  graduated from 3d. in the £ on incomes between £50 to £500; 6d. on
  incomes between £500 and £1,000; an additional 6d. up to £4,000; and then
  1s. on every additional £1,000 until we get to an income tax of 20s. in
  the £ on an income of £22,000 a year.</p>

  <p>The popularity of Paine's proposals in England and the Reign of Terror
  in France frightened the British Government into a policy of fierce
  persecution against all who bought, sold, lent or borrowed the "Rights of
  Man." "Constitutional Societies" were suppressed, and all who dared
  openly express sympathy with revolutions or republics were promptly
  arrested.</p>

  <p>Paine, outlawed by the British Government, contended in the National
  Convention for a republican constitution for France, did his best to
  prevent the execution of Louis XVI., fell with the Girondins, was thrown
  into prison, and only escaped with his life by an accident. Then, under
  the very shadow of the guillotine Paine wrote his "Age of Reason," to
  recall France from atheism to a mild humanitarian theism. This book was
  fatal to Paine's reputation. Henceforth the violent denunciation of
  theological opponents pursued him to the grave, and left his name a
  byword to the orthodox. As Paine's contribution to the body of democratic
  belief in the "Rights of Man" was submerged in the discussion on his
  religious opinions, so was his early plea for what he called "Agrarian
  Justice." On his release from a prison cell in the Luxembourg, in 1795,
  Paine published his "Plan for a National Fund." This plan was an
  anticipation of our modern proposals for Land Reform. Paine urged the
  taxation of land values&mdash;the payment to the community of a
  ground-rent&mdash;and argued for death duties as "the least troublesome
  method" of raising revenue. It was in the preface to this pamphlet on
  "Agrarian Justice" that Paine replied to Bishop Watson's sermon on "The
  Wisdom and Goodness of God in having made both Rich and Poor." "It is
  wrong," wrote Paine, "to say God made rich and poor; He made only male
  and female, and gave them the earth for their inheritance."</p>

  <p>Napoleon organised the plebiscite, which conferred on him the
  Consulate for life, in 1802, and the French Revolution and Constitution
  making having yielded to a military dictatorship, Paine returned to
  America, and died in New York in 1809.</p>

<h4><font class="sc">Major Cartwright and the "Radical Reformers"</font></h4>

  <p>John Cartwright, the "Father of Reform," is notable as the first of
  the English "Radical Reformers." His direct influence on politics was
  small&mdash;none of his writings had the success of the "Rights of
  Man"&mdash;but, like Paine, he laboured to turn England by public opinion
  from aristocracy to democracy, and for more than forty years Cartwright
  was to the fore with his programme of Radical reform. The problem for
  Cartwright and the Radical reformers was how to get the changes made
  which would give political power to the people&mdash;with whom was the
  sovereignty, as they had learnt from Locke&mdash;and make Parliament the
  instrument of democracy. A hundred years and more have not sufficed to
  get this problem answered to everybody's satisfaction, but in the latter
  part of the eighteenth century, to the minds of simple, honest men, it
  seemed enough that the argument should be stated plainly and reasonably;
  it would follow that all mankind would be speedily convinced; so great
  was the faith in the power of reason.</p>

  <p>What neither Cartwright nor Paine understood was, that it was not the
  reasonableness of a proposed reform but the strength of the demand that
  carried the day. The revolt and independence of the American Colonies
  were not due to a political preference for a republic, but were the work
  of public opinion driven by misgovernment to protest. The difficulty in
  England was that the mass of people might be in great wretchedness, badly
  housed, ill-fed, and generally neglected, but they were not conscious of
  any desire for democracy. They were against the government, doubtless,
  and willing enough, in London, to shout for "Wilkes and Liberty," but the
  time had not yet come for the working class to believe that
  enfranchisement was a remedy for the ills they endured.</p>

  <p>Major Cartwright was an exceedingly fine type of man; conscientious,
  public spirited, humane, and utterly without personal ambition. He
  resigned his commission in the Navy because he believed it wrong to fight
  against the American Colonies, and he organised a county militia for the
  sake of national defence. On the pedestal beneath his statue in
  Cartwright Gardens, just south of Euston Road, in London, the virtues of
  the "Father of Reform" are described at length, and he is mentioned as
  "the firm, consistent and persevering advocate of <i>universal
  suffrage</i>, equal representation, vote by ballot, and annual
  Parliaments." It was in 1777 that Cartwright published his first pamphlet
  entitled "Legislative Rights Vindicated," and pleaded for "a return to
  the ancient and constitutional practice of Edward III." and the election
  of annual Parliaments. Long Parliaments were the root of all social
  political evil, Cartwright argued. War, national debt, distress,
  depopulation, land out of cultivation, Parliamentary debate itself become
  a mockery&mdash;these calamities were all due to long Parliaments; and
  would be cured if once a year&mdash;on June 1st&mdash;a fresh Parliament
  was elected by the votes of every man over eighteen&mdash;by ballot and
  without any plural voting&mdash;and a payment of two guineas a day was
  made to members on their attendance. Of course, Cartwright could not help
  writing "all are by nature free, all are by nature equal"&mdash;no
  political reformer in the eighteenth century could do
  otherwise&mdash;but, unlike his contemporaries, the Major was a stout
  Christian, and insisted that as the whole plan of Christianity was
  founded on the equality of all mankind, political rights must have the
  same foundation. By the political axiom that "no man shall be taxed but
  with his own consent, given either by himself or his own representative
  in Parliament," Cartwright may be quoted as one who had some perception
  of what democracy meant in England; but he is off the track again in
  arguing that personality, and not the possession of property, was the
  sole foundation of the right of being represented in Parliament. It was
  the possession of property that brought taxation, and with taxation the
  right to representation. We cannot repeat too often that in England the
  progress to democracy has never been made on assumptions of an abstract
  right to vote. We have come to democracy by experience, and this
  experience has taught us that people who are taxed insist, sooner or
  later, on having a voice in the administration of the national exchequer.
  But we have never admitted "personality" as a title to
  enfranchisement.</p>

    <h4>THE GORDON RIOTS</h4>

    <i>From the Painting by Seymour Lucas, R.A.</i>
  </div>
  <p>Cartwright followed with the multitude of political writers of his
  time to deduce a right to vote, and his deduction is as worthless as the
  rest of the <i>a priori</i> reasoning. But the brave old man&mdash;he was
  tried for "sedition" at the age of eighty in the Government panic of
  1820&mdash;was an entirely disinterested champion of the poor and a real
  lover of liberty. He believed the affairs of government ought to be a
  matter of common concern, and that they were quite within the capacities
  of ordinary men. Cartwright's life&mdash;much more than his
  writings&mdash;kept the democratic ideal unshaken in the handful of
  "Radical Reformers" who survived the Tory reaction on the war with the
  French Republic in 1793, and his glowing enthusiasm helped to kindle the
  fire for political enfranchisement that was burning in the hearts of the
  manufacturing population by 1818. But in 1777 the electorate was not
  anxious for reform, and the unenfranchised gave no thought to their
  political disabilities. On the very day in 1780 that the Duke of Richmond
  proposed, in the House of Lords, a resolution in favour of manhood
  suffrage and annual Parliaments, the London mob, stirred up by the
  anti-Catholic fanaticism of Lord George Gordon, marched to Westminster
  with a petition to repeal Savile's Act of 1778, which allowed Catholics
  to bequeath land and to educate their own children. There was a riot, and
  in the course of the next six days the mob burnt Newgate, sacked Catholic
  chapels, and generally plundered and ravaged the City.</p>

  <p>In the House of Commons Pitt made three attempts to get reform
  considered&mdash;in 1782, 1783 and 1785&mdash;and on each occasion his
  resolution was defeated by an overwhelming majority. After that Pitt made
  no further effort for reform, and from 1793 to 1795 the Government he led
  passed the Acts of repressive legislation which made all democratic
  propaganda illegal, and crushed all political agitation.</p>

  <p>But "the Cause" was not dead.</p>

  <p>Sir Francis Burdett, M.P. for Westminster, Henry Hunt, better known as
  "Orator Hunt," and Cobbett with his "Political Register," in various ways
  renewed the campaign for manhood suffrage, and the growth of the
  manufacturing districts made a change in the constitution of Parliament
  imperative.</p>

  <p>Burdett was sent to the Tower in 1810 for contempt of Parliament, but
  lived to see the Reform Bill of 1831 passed into law, and died a Tory.
  Cobbett spent two years in prison, and became M.P. for Oldham in 1832.
  What Cobbett did with pen&mdash;and no man at that day wrote with greater
  ability for the common people, or with greater acceptance&mdash;Hunt did
  on the platform. Both strove to arouse the working class to demand
  enfranchisement. Hunt presided at the mass meeting at Peterloo, by
  Manchester, in 1819&mdash;an entirely peaceful meeting which was broken
  up by the military with some loss of life&mdash;and was sent to prison
  for two years for doing so. He also was elected M.P. (for Preston) in the
  first reformed Parliament.</p>

  <p>Again the Government tried coercion, and after Peterloo, for the next
  few years, intimidation and numerous arrests kept down all outward
  manifestation of the reform movement.</p>

  <p>In spite of this, the movement could not be stayed. Each year saw
  political indifference changed to positive desire for enfranchisement,
  and the British public, which, in the main, had been left untouched by
  the vision of a democracy and the call for a national convention and a
  new constitution, became impatient for the reform of Parliament and the
  representation of the manufacturing interest.</p>

<h4><font class="sc">Thomas Spence</font> (1750-1814)</h4>

  <p>The name of Spence must be mentioned amongst those who preached the
  democratic idea at the close of the eighteenth century. A Newcastle
  schoolmaster, Spence, in 1775, expounded his "Plan" for land
  nationalisation on the following lines:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"The land, with all that appertains to it, is in every parish made the
  property of the Corporation or parish, with as ample power to let,
  repair, or alter all or any part thereof, as a lord of the manor enjoys
  over his lands, houses, etc.; but the power of alienating the least
  morsel, in any manner, from the parish, either at this or any time
  thereafter, is denied. For it is solemnly agreed to, by the whole nation,
  that a parish that shall either sell or give away any part of its landed
  property shall be looked upon with as much horror and detestation as if
  they had sold all their children to be slaves, or massacred them with
  their own hands. Thus are there no more or other landlords in the whole
  country than the parishes, and each of them is sovereign lord of its
  territories.</p>

  <p>"Then you may behold the rent which the people have paid into the
  parish treasuries employed by each parish in paying the Parliament or
  National Congress at any time grants; in maintaining and relieving its
  own poor people out of work; in paying the necessary officers their
  salaries; in building, repairing, and adorning its houses, bridges, and
  other structures; in making and maintaining convenient and delightful
  streets, highways, and passages both for foot and carriages; in making
  and maintaining canals and other conveniences for trade and navigation;
  in planting and taking in waste grounds; in providing and keeping up a
  magazine of ammunition and all sorts of arms sufficient for all the
  inhabitants in case of danger from enemies; in premiums for the
  encouragement of agriculture, or anything else thought worthy of
  encouragement; and, in a word, doing whatever the people think proper,
  and not as formerly, to support and spread luxury, pride, and all manner
  of vice."</p>

  <p>No taxes of any kind were to be paid by native or foreigner "but the
  aforesaid rent, which every person pays to the parish according to the
  quantity, quality, and conveniences of the land, housing, etc., which he
  occupies in it. The Government, poor, roads, etc., are all maintained by
  the parishes with the rent, on which account all wares, manufactures,
  allowable trade employments, or actions are entirely duty free."</p>

  <p>The "Plan" ends with the usual confidence of the idealist reformer of
  the time in the speedy triumph of right, and in the world-wide acceptance
  of what seemed to its author so eminently reasonable a proposal.</p>

  <p>"What makes this prospect yet more glowing is that after this empire
  of right and reason is thus established it will stand for ever. Force and
  corruption attempting its downfall shall equally be baffled, and all
  other nations, struck with wonder and admiration at its happiness and
  stability, shall follow the example; and thus the whole earth shall at
  last be happy, and live like brethren."</p>

  <p>The American War and the French Revolution hindered the consideration
  of Spence's "empire of right and reason," but, in the course of nearly
  forty years' advocacy of land nationalisation, Spence gathered round him
  a band of disciples in London, and the Spenceans were a recognised body
  of reformers in the early part of the nineteenth century. The attacks on
  private property in land, and the revolutionary proposals for giving the
  landlords notice to quit, brought down the wrath of the Government on
  Spence, and he was constantly being arrested, fined and imprisoned for
  "seditious libel," while his bookshop in Holborn was as frequently
  ransacked by the authorities.</p>

  <p>Spence died in 1814, and the movement for abolishing the landlords in
  favour of common ownership languished and stopped. The interesting thing
  about Spence's "Plan" is its anticipation of Henry George's propaganda
  for a Single Tax on Land Values, and the extinction of all other methods
  of raising national revenue, a propaganda that, in a modified form for
  the taxation of land values, has already earned the approval of the House
  of Commons.</p>

<h4><font class="sc">Practical Politics and Democratic Ideals</font></h4>

  <p>Because we insist on the experimental character of our British
  political progress, and the steady refusal to accept speculative ideas
  and <i>a priori</i> deductions in politics, it does not follow that the
  services of the idealist are to be unrecognised.</p>

  <p>The work of the idealist, whether he is a writer or a man of
  action&mdash;and sometimes, as in the case of Mazzini, he is
  both&mdash;is to stir the souls of men and shake them out of sluggish
  torpor, or rouse them from gross absorption in personal gain, and from
  dull, self-satisfied complacency. He is the prophet, the agitator, the
  pioneer, and after him follow the responsible statesmen, who rarely see
  far ahead or venture on new paths. Once or twice in the world's history
  the practical statesman is an idealist, as Abraham Lincoln was, but the
  combination of qualities is unusual. The political idealist gets his
  vision in solitary places, the democratic statesman gets his experience
  of men by rubbing shoulders with the crowd.</p>

  <p>A democratic nation must have its seers and prophets, lest it forget
  its high calling to press forward, and so sink in the slough of contented
  ease. The preacher of ideals is the architect of a nation's hopes and
  desires, and the fulfilment of these hopes and desires will depend on the
  wisdom of its political builders&mdash;the practical politicians. Often
  enough the structural alterations are so extensive that the architect
  does not recognise his plan; and that is probably as it should be; for it
  is quite likely that the architect left out of account so simple a matter
  as the staircase in his house beautiful, and the builder is bound to
  adapt the plan to ordinary human needs.</p>

  <p>The idealist has a faith in the future of his cause that exceeds the
  average faith, and in his sure confidence fails to understand why his
  neighbours will not follow at his call, or move more rapidly; and so he
  fails as a practical leader.</p>

  <p>Here the work of the statesman and politician comes in. They are
  nearer to the mass of people, they hold their authority by election of
  the people, and they understand that the rate of speed must be slow.
  Under the guidance of their political leaders, the people are willing to
  move.</p>

  <p>Sometimes the idealist is frankly revolutionary, is for beginning anew
  in politics, and starting society all over again. If the state of things
  is bad enough, he may get into power, as he did in France at the
  Revolution, and for a time the world will stagger at his doings. But
  there is no beginning <i>de novo</i> in politics, and the revolutions
  wrought by men who would give the world an entirely fresh start (to be
  distinguished from mere changes of dynasty, such as our English
  Revolution was) have their sandy foundations washed away by the floods of
  reaction.</p>

  <p>There is no such absolute escape from the past for men or nations, and
  we can only build our new social and political order on the foundations
  of experience. But we may not be moved to build at all but for the
  prophet and the agitator, and therefore the instinct that makes
  governments slay or imprison the political agitator and suppress the
  writings of political prophets can be understood. For the existence of
  every government is threatened by prophets and agitators, and in
  self-defence it resists innovation. A healthy democracy will allow too
  many opportunities for popular expression to fear innovation; yet even
  under a democracy the prophets have been stoned&mdash;their sepulchres to
  be subsequently erected by public subscription and handsomely
  decorated.</p>

  <p>Democracy owes too much to its prophets in the past not to rejoice at
  their presence in its midst. But it will prudently leave the direction of
  its public affairs to men who, less gifted it may be in finding new
  paths, are more experienced in making the roads that others have
  discovered fit for the heavy tread of multitudes.</p>

<h3>PARLIAMENTARY REFORM AND THE ENFRANCHISEMENT
OF THE PEOPLE</h3>

<h4><font class="sc">The Industrial Revolution</font></h4>

  <p>The industrial revolution of the eighteenth century changed the face
  of England and brought to the manufacturing class wealth and prominence.
  The population of Lancashire was not more than 300,000 in 1760, the West
  Riding of Yorkshire about 360,000, and the total population of England
  6,000,000. The inventions of Arkwright, Hargreaves, Crompton, Watt, and
  Cartwright revolutionised the cotton trade in the last twenty years of
  the eighteenth century, and increased enormously the production of
  woollen goods. England ceased to be mainly a nation of farmers and
  merchants; domestic manufacture gave way to the factory system; the
  labouring people, unable to make a living in the country, gathered into
  the towns. The long series of Enclosure Acts&mdash;1760-1843&mdash;turned
  seven million acres of common land into private property, and with this
  change in agrarian conditions and the growth of population England ceased
  to be a corn-exporting country, and became dependent on foreign nations
  for its food supply.</p>

  <p>While these industrial and agrarian changes meant a striking increase
  in wealth and population, they were accompanied by untold misery to the
  common people.</p>

  <p>"Instead of the small master working in his own home with his one or
  two apprentices and journeymen, the rich capitalist-employer with his
  army of factory hands grew up. Many of these masters were rough,
  illiterate and hard, though shrewd and far-seeing in business. The
  workmen were forced to work for long hours in dark, dirty and unwholesome
  workshops. The State did nothing to protect them; the masters only
  thought of their profits; the national conscience was dead, and unjust
  laws prevented them combining together in trade unions to help
  themselves. Women and children were made to work as long and as hard as
  the men. A regular system grew up of transporting pauper and destitute
  children to weary factory work. There was no care for their health. There
  were few churches and chapels, though the Methodists often did something
  to prevent the people from falling back into heathendom. The workmen were
  ignorant, brutal, poor and oppressed. There were no schools and plenty of
  public houses. In hard times distress was widespread, and the workmen
  naturally listened to agitators and fanatics, or took to violent means of
  avenging their wrongs, for they had no constitutional means of redress.
  Even the masters had no votes, as the new towns sent no members to
  Parliament. The transfer of the balance of population and wealth from the
  south and east to the north and Midlands made Parliamentary reform
  necessary."<a name="footnotetag76"
  href="#footnote76"><sup>[76]</sup></a></p>

  <p>With this transfer of the balance of economic power came a good deal
  of rivalry between the manufacturers and the landed gentry, the latter
  becoming more and more Tory, the former more and more Radical. As all
  political power, in the main, was in the landowner's hands, men anxious
  to take part in politics eagerly bought up the small estates, and the old
  yeoman class disappeared, except in out-of-the-way places. These yeomen
  and small landowners had been the backbone of the Parliamentary Party in
  the days of the Stuarts, but they were left hopelessly behind in an age
  of mechanical inventions and agrarian changes, and were in most cases
  glad to sell out and invest their property in other ways.</p>

  <p>The story of the misery of rural depopulation in the first half of the
  sixteenth century repeats itself at the close of the eighteenth.</p>

  <p>"A single farmer held as one farm the lands that once formed fourteen
  farms, bringing up respectably fourteen families. The capitalist farmer
  came in like the capitalist employer. His gangs of poor and ignorant
  labourers were the counterpart of the swarm of factory hands. The
  business of farming was worked more scientifically, with better tools and
  greater success; but after the middle of the eighteenth century the
  condition of the agricultural labourer got no better, and now the great
  mass of the rural population were mere labourers.... Pauperism became
  more and more a pressing evil, especially after 1782, when <i>Gilbert's
  Act</i> abolished the workhouse test (which compelled all who received
  relief from the rates to go into the half-imprisonment of a poor-house),
  and the system of poor law doles in aid of wages was encouraged by the
  high prices at the end of the century. In 1803 one-seventh of the people
  was in receipt of poor law relief."<a name="footnotetag77"
  href="#footnote77"><sup>[77]</sup></a></p>

  <p>But with all the considerable distress, in town and country alike
  amongst the working people, at the beginning of the nineteenth century,
  swift progress was taking place in agriculture and in manufactures. Only,
  the accumulated wealth fell into fewer hands, and the fluctuations in the
  demand for goods, caused partly by the opening up of new markets, brought
  successions of good times and bad times. "The workmen shared but
  partially in the prosperity, and were the first to bear the brunt of hard
  times."<a name="footnotetag78" href="#footnote78"><sup>[78]</sup></a></p>

<h4><font class="sc">The Need for Parliamentary Reform</font></h4>

  <p>The point for us to note here is that the changed economic conditions
  made Parliamentary reform a necessity, and brought the question of
  popular enfranchisement within sight. It was useless for Burke to
  maintain the incomparable beauty of the British constitution; English
  politicians might be indifferent to political theories of democracy, and
  heartily dislike any notion of radical change, but the abuses were too
  obvious to prevent reform.</p>

  <p>Whatever the size of the county it returned two members elected by
  freeholders, and the cost of a county election was enormous. Some of the
  boroughs, especially in Cornwall, were tiny villages. Eighteen members
  were returned from such boroughs in that part of Cornwall which now
  returns one member for the Liskeard Division. The fields of Old Sarum
  belonged to seven electors and returned two members. As there was no
  habitation whatever in this "borough" of Old Sarum, a tent was put up for
  the convenience of the returning officer at election times. No general
  law decided the borough franchise. Local custom and various political and
  personal considerations settled who should vote for members of
  Parliament. Places like Westminster and Preston had practically manhood
  suffrage. In most of the "corporation boroughs" the franchise was
  restricted exclusively to freemen of the borough, and to the self-elected
  non-resident persons who composed the governing body before the Municipal
  Corporation Act of 1835. A small number of rich and powerful men really
  worked nearly all the elections. Seats were openly bought and sold, and a
  candidate had either to find a patron who would provide him with a seat,
  or, failing a patron, to purchase a seat himself. Fox first entered
  Parliament for the pocket borough of Midhurst, and Sir George Trevelyan
  has described how it took place. Midhurst was selected by the father of
  Charles James Fox as "the most comfortable of constituencies from the
  point of view of a representative; for the right of election rested in a
  few small holdings, on which no human being resided, distinguished among
  the pastures and the stubble that surrounded them by a large stone set up
  on end in the middle of each portion. These burbage tenures, as they were
  called, had all been bought up by a single proprietor, Viscount Montagu,
  who when an election was in prospect, assigned a few of them to his
  servants, with instructions to nominate the members and then make back
  the property to their employer. This ceremony was performed in March,
  1768, and the steward of the estate, who acted as the returning officer,
  declared that Charles James Fox had been duly chosen as one of the
  burgesses for Midhurst, at a time when that young gentleman was still
  amusing himself in Italy."</p>

  <p>Three years earlier Burke had entered Parliament as a nominee of Lord
  Rockingham's. Gibbon sat in the House for some years under patronage.
  Gladstone first became a member by presentation to a pocket borough, and
  later spoke in praise of this method of bringing young men of promise
  into Parliament. John Wilson Croker estimated that of six hundred and
  fifty-eight members of the House of Commons at the end of the eighteenth
  century, two hundred and seventy-six were returned by patrons. Men of
  more independence of mind who could afford to buy seats did so, and many
  of the reformers&mdash;including Burdett, Romilly and Hume&mdash;thus sat
  in the House.</p>

<h4><font class="sc">Manufacturing Centres Unrepresented in Parliament</font></h4>

  <p>It was not so much that the landowning aristocracy were
  over-represented in Parliament by their control of so many pocket
  boroughs, as that great manufacturing centres were entirely
  unrepresented. The middle-class manufacturers had no means of making
  their influence felt in the unreformed House of Commons, for towns of
  such importance as Leeds, Manchester and Birmingham sent no
  representatives to Parliament. This meant that Parliament was out of
  touch with all the industrial life of the nation, and that nothing was
  done till after the Reform Act in the way of serious industrial
  legislation.</p>

<pre>
35 constituencies with hardly any voters at all returned       75 members
46 constituencies with less than 50 voters in each returned    90    "
19 constituencies with less than 100 voters in each returned   37    "
26 constituencies with less than 200 voters in each returned   52    "
84 male electors in other constituencies returned             157    "

</pre>
  <p>The Reform Act of 1832 changed all this. It disfranchised all boroughs
  with less than 2,000 inhabitants&mdash;fifty-six in all; allowed one
  member only to boroughs with between 2,000 and 4,000; gave
  representatives to Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, and to several other
  large manufacturing towns and London boroughs; extended the county
  franchise to leaseholders and £50 tenants at will; and settled the
  borough franchise on a uniform qualification of occupation in a house of
  £10 rateable value. It also fixed two days, instead of fifteen, as the
  limit for county elections, and one day for boroughs.</p>

<h4><font class="sc">The Passage of the Great Reform Bill</font></h4>

  <p>The Reform Bill was not carried without much rioting in the country,
  and some loss of life.</p>

  <p>The Duke of Wellington was at the head of the Tory Ministry in 1830;
  and though he declared in face of an Opposition that was headed by the
  Whig aristocrats, and included the middle-class manufacturers and the
  great bulk of the working class in the industrial districts of
  Lancashire, Yorkshire and the Midlands, that "no better system (of
  Parliamentary representation) could be devised by the wit of man" than
  the unreformed House of Commons, and that he would never bring forward a
  reform measure himself, and should always feel it his duty to resist such
  measure when proposed by others, yet, in less than two years after this
  speech Wellington's resistance had ended, and the Reform Bill was carried
  into law.</p>

  <p>What happened in those two years was this: At the general election in
  the summer of 1831, the popular cry was "the Bill, the whole Bill, and
  nothing but the Bill."</p>

  <p>"The whole countless multitude of reformers had laid hold of the
  principle that the most secure and the shortest way of obtaining what
  they wanted was to obtain representation. The non-electors felt
  themselves called upon to put forth such power as they had as a means to
  obtaining the power which they claimed." And the non-electors were
  enormously successful. For they "combined their will, their knowledge,
  and their manifest force in political unions, whence they sent forth
  will, knowledge, and influence over wide districts of the land. And the
  electors, seeing the importance of the crisis&mdash;the unspeakable
  importance that it should be well conducted&mdash;joined these
  unions."</p>

  <p>The Reformers carried the day at the elections, and the new House of
  Commons passed the second reading of the Bill on July 8th, by 136:
  367-231. On September 21st the third reading passed by 345 to 236. Then
  on the 8th of October the House of Lords threw out the Bill by 199 to
  158, and at once fierce riots broke out all over the country, in especial
  at Derby, Nottingham, and Bristol.</p>

  <p>At Derby the jail was stormed. At Nottingham the castle was burned,
  and of nine men subsequently convicted of riot, three were hanged. At
  Bristol, the jail, the Mansion House, the Customs House, the Excise
  Office, and the Bishop's Palace were burned, and twelve lives were lost
  in three days.</p>

  <p>The new session opened in December, and again the Bill was introduced,
  and this time the second reading had a majority of 162: 324-162. The
  House of Lords hesitated when the Bill came up to them at the end of
  March, 1832; allowed the second reading to pass by 184 to 175, and then
  in Committee struck out those clauses which disfranchised the "rotten"
  boroughs&mdash;uninhabited constituencies like Old Sarum. Grey, the Whig
  Prime Minister, at once resigned, and the Duke of Wellington endeavoured
  to form a Tory anti-reform Ministry. But the task was beyond him, the
  temper of the country was impatient of any further postponement of the
  Bill. Petitions poured in urging Parliament to vote no supplies, and
  resolutions were passed refusing to pay taxes till the Bill became
  law.</p>

  <p>On Wellington's failure to make a Government, William IV. had to
  recall Grey, and the Whigs resumed office with an assurance that, if
  necessary, the King would create sufficient peers favourable to reform,
  so that the Bill should pass.</p>

  <p>The battle was over, the anti-Reformers retired, and on June 4th,
  1832, the Reform Bill passed the Lords by 106 to 22, receiving the Royal
  Assent three days later.</p>

  <p>The Whigs protested that the Reform Bill was <i>a final measure</i>,
  and Sir Francis Burdett, the veteran reformer, was content to vote with
  the Tories when the Act had become law. But there is no finality in
  politics, and the Reform Bill was only the removal of a barrier on the
  road to democracy. The Tories described the Bill as revolutionary, but as
  a matter of fact the Act of 1832 neither fulfilled the hopes of its
  friends nor the fears of its foes. What the Act did was to transfer the
  balance of power from the landed aristocracy, which had been in the main
  predominant since 1688, to the richer members of the middle
  class&mdash;the big farmers in the country, the prosperous shopkeepers in
  the towns. The working class was still voteless, and the old democratic
  franchise of Preston and Westminster was gone from those boroughs.</p>

  <p>The first reformed Parliament met early in 1833, and the change in the
  character of the House of Commons was seen at once. Government accepted
  responsibility for legislation in a way that had never been known before.
  The New Poor Law, 1834, and the new Municipal Corporations Act, 1835,
  were the beginning of our present system of local government. Slavery was
  abolished in all British Colonies in 1833.</p>

  <p>Greville, in his Memoirs, gives us an impression of the new regime in
  Parliament as it appeared to one who belonged to the old dethroned
  aristocracy.</p>

  <p>"The first thing that strikes one is its inferiority to preceding
  Houses of Commons, and the presumption, impertinence, and
  self-sufficiency of the new members.... There exists no <i>party</i> but
  that of the Government; the Irish act in a body under O'Connell to the
  number of about forty; the Radicals are scattered up and down without a
  leader, numerous, restless, turbulent, bold, and active; the Tories,
  without a head, frightened, angry, and sulky."</p>

<h4><font class="sc">The Working Class Still Unrepresented</font></h4>

  <p>But the working classes were the really disappointed people in the
  country. They had worked for the reformers, and their energies&mdash;and
  their violence&mdash;had been the driving force that had carried the Bill
  into law. If their expectations were extravagant and their hopes
  over-heated, the more bitter was their distress at the failure of the
  Reform Act to accomplish the social improvements that had been
  predicted.</p>

<h4><font class="sc">Chartism</font></h4>

  <p>So the working class in despair of help from the Government, decided
  to get the franchise for themselves, and for twelve years, 1838-1850,
  Chartism was the great popular movement. The <i>Five Points of the
  People's Charter</i> were proclaimed in 1838: (1) Universal Suffrage; (2)
  Vote by Ballot; (3) Annual Parliaments; (4) Abolition of Property
  Qualification for Members of Parliament; (5) Payment of Members. A Sixth
  Point&mdash;Equal Electoral Districts&mdash;was left out in the National
  Petition.</p>

  <p>Although the Chartist demands were political, it was the social misery
  of the time that drove men and women into the Chartist movement. The
  wretchedness of their lot&mdash;its hopeless outlook, and the horrible
  housing conditions in the big towns&mdash;these things seemed intolerable
  to the more intelligent of the working people, and thousands flocked to
  the monster Chartist demonstrations, and found comfort in the orations of
  Feargus O'Connor, Bronterre O'Brien, and Ernest Jones.</p>

  <p>The Charter promised political enfranchisement to the labouring
  people, and once enfranchised they could work out by legislation their
  own social salvation. So it seemed in the 'Forties&mdash;when one in
  every eleven of the industrial population was a pauper.</p>

  <p>Stephens, a "hot-headed" Chartist preacher, put the case as he, a
  typical agitator of the day, saw it in 1839: "The principle of the
  People's Charter is the right of every man to have his home, his hearth,
  and his happiness. The question of universal suffrage is, after all, a
  knife-and-fork question. It means that every workman has a right to have
  a good hat and coat, a good roof, a good dinner, no more work than will
  keep him in health, and as much wages as will keep him in plenty."<a
  name="footnotetag79" href="#footnote79"><sup>[79]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The lot of the labourer and the artisan was found to be worse than it
  was in the earlier years of the nineteenth century, before the great
  Reform Act had been passed.<a name="footnotetag80"
  href="#footnote80"><sup>[80]</sup></a> And while the Anti-Corn Law
  League, the Socialist propaganda of Robert Owen, and the agitation for
  factory legislation, all promised help and attracted large numbers of
  workmen, the Chartist movement was by far the strongest and most
  revolutionary of all the post-reform popular agitations. Chartism went to
  pieces because the leaders could not work together, and were, in fact,
  greatly divided as to the methods and objects of the movement. By 1848
  Bronterre O'Brien had retired from the Chartist ranks, Feargus O'Connor
  was M.P. for Nottingham&mdash;to be led away from the House of Commons
  hopelessly insane, to die in 1855&mdash;and Ernest Jones could only say
  when the Chartist Convention broke up in hopeless disagreement, "amid the
  desertion of friends, and the invasion of enemies, the fusee has been
  trampled out, and elements of our energy are scattered to the winds of
  heaven."</p>

  <p>In spite of its failure, Chartism kept alive for many years the desire
  for political enfranchisement in the labouring classes. That desire never
  died out. Although Palmerston, the "Tory chief of a Radical
  Cabinet"&mdash;so Disraeli accurately enough described him&mdash;was
  Prime Minister from 1855 to 1865 (with one short interval), and during
  that period gave no encouragement to political reform, the opinion in the
  country grew steadily in favour of working-class enfranchisement.
  Palmerston's very inactivity drove Liberals and the younger Conservatives
  to look to the working classes for support for the measures that were
  planned. The middle class was satisfied that the artisans could be
  admitted to the franchise without danger to the Constitution.
  Palmerston's death in 1865 left the Liberal Party to Earl Russell's
  premiership, with Gladstone as its leader in the Commons. Reform was now
  inevitable.</p>

  <p>The Bill as first introduced in 1866 was a moderate measure, making a
  £7 rental the qualification for a vote in the boroughs. It was too
  moderate to provoke any enthusiasm, and it was hateful to the old
  Palmerstonian Whigs and most of the Conservatives, who objected to any
  enfranchisement of the working class. By a combination of these opponents
  the Bill was defeated, the Liberals retired from office, and a
  Conservative ministry under Lord Derby, with Disraeli leading the House
  of Commons, was formed.</p>

<h4><font class="sc">The Hyde Park Railings</font> (1866)</h4>

  <p>It was seen quickly that there was a very real demand for the
  enfranchisement of the town workman&mdash;the agricultural districts
  remained unawakened&mdash;and Reform Leagues and Reform Unions sprang up
  as they had done in 1831. Then in London came the incident of the Hyde
  Park railings, which gave a distinct impetus to the Reform movement. What
  happened at Hyde Park was this: the London Reform Union decided to hold a
  monster demonstration in Hyde Park on July 23rd, but the Chief
  Commissioner of Police had declared the meeting must not take place, and
  ordered the gates to be closed at five o'clock. Mr. Edmund Beales, and
  other leaders of the London Reform Union, on being refused admittance,
  drove away calmly to hold a meeting in Trafalgar Square, but the great
  mass of people remained outside the park, "pressed and pressing round the
  railings." Some were clinging to the railings; others deliberately
  weakened the supports of the railings. Park Lane was thronged, and all
  along the Bayswater Road there was a dense crowd. The line was too long
  for the police to defend, and presently, when the railings yielded to the
  pressure, the people poured in to the park.</p>

  <p>"There was a simultaneous, impulsive rush, and some yards of railing
  were down, and men in scores were tumbling and floundering and rushing
  over them. The example was followed along Park Lane, and in a moment half
  a mile of iron railings was lying on the grass, and a tumultuous and
  delighted mob was swarming over the park. The news ran wildly through the
  town. Some thought it a revolt; others were of opinion it was a
  revolution. The first day of liberty was proclaimed here&mdash;the
  breaking loose of anarchy was shrieked at there. The mob capered and
  jumped over the sward for half the night through. Flower beds and shrubs
  suffered a good deal, not so much from wanton destruction, as from the
  pure boisterousness which came of an unexpected opportunity for
  horseplay. There were a good many little encounters with the police;
  stones were thrown on the one side, and truncheons used on the other
  pretty freely. A few heads were broken on both sides, and a few prisoners
  were made by the police; but there was no revolution, no revolt, no
  serious riot even."<a name="footnotetag81"
  href="#footnote81"><sup>[81]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The Guards were called out, and a detachment arrived at the park, but
  the people only cheered the soldiers good-humouredly. Not even a blank
  cartridge was fired that day.</p>

  <p>The Government, however, took the Hyde Park disturbance with extreme
  seriousness. "Nothing can well be more certain than the fact that the
  Hyde Park riot, as it was called, convinced Her Majesty's ministers of
  the necessity of an immediate adoption of the reform principle."<a
  name="footnotetag82" href="#footnote82"><sup>[82]</sup></a> Disraeli, who
  in 1859 had proposed reform without getting any support, now saw that a
  great opportunity had come for a constructive Conservative policy, and
  boldly insisted to his party that Parliamentary Reform was a necessity.
  "You cannot establish a party of mere resistance to change, for change is
  inevitable in a progressive country," he told his followers.</p>

  <p>All through the autumn and winter great demonstrations took place in
  the large towns and cities of the country in support of the demand for
  the enfranchisement of the workman, and when Parliament met in February,
  1867, a Reform Bill was promised in the Queen's Speech. To Lord Derby the
  measure was frankly a "leap in the dark," and one or two Conservative
  ministers (including Cranborne, afterwards Lord Salisbury) left the
  Government in disgust. But the Conservatives generally chuckled at
  "dishing the Whigs," and the Bill, with considerable revision, was passed
  through both Houses of Parliament by August.</p>

<h4><font class="sc">Household Suffrage</font></h4>

  <p>By the Reform Bill of 1867 all male householders in boroughs were
  enfranchised, and all male lodgers who paid £10 a year for unfurnished
  rooms. The town workman was enfranchised by this Act as the middle-class
  man had been enfranchised by the Act of 1832, and the electorate was
  increased from about 100,000 to 2,000,000. An amendment that women should
  not be excluded from the franchise was moved by John Stuart Mill, and
  defeated. Some redistribution of seats took place under the Act of 1867,
  eleven boroughs were disfranchised, thirty-five with less than 10,000
  inhabitants were made single-member constituencies, and additional
  representation was given to Chelsea, Hackney, Leeds, Liverpool,
  Manchester, Salford, Glasgow, Birmingham, Dundee, and Merthyr. "Thus was
  <i>Household Suffrage</i> brought in in the boroughs, and a great step
  was made towards democracy, for it was plain that the middle-class county
  constituencies could not last very much longer now that all workmen who
  happened to live in boroughs had their votes."<a name="footnotetag83"
  href="#footnote83"><sup>[83]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The third Reform Act, giving household suffrage to the country
  districts, was passed by Gladstone in 1884, and it was followed by a
  Redistribution of Seats Act in 1885. By these two Acts the agricultural
  labourer was enfranchised, a service franchise was created for those who
  were qualified neither as householders nor lodgers, and the principle of
  single-member equal electoral districts&mdash;on a basis of 54,000
  inhabitants&mdash;was adopted. Only twenty-three boroughs, the City of
  London and the Universities of Oxford, Cambridge, and Dublin, retained
  double-member representation. The membership of the House of Commons was
  increased from six hundred and fifty-eight to six hundred and seventy,
  the present total; and the franchise remains as it was fixed in
  1885&mdash;occupation and ownership giving the right to vote.</p>

  <p>From time to time, for more than a hundred years, a plea has been put
  forward for universal or adult suffrage for men on the ground of an
  abstract right to vote, but it has met with little encouragement.<a
  name="footnotetag84" href="#footnote84"><sup>[84]</sup></a> There is,
  however, a wide feeling in favour of simplifying the registration laws,
  so that a three-months' residence, instead of, as at present, a year's
  residence from one July to the next, should be sufficient to qualify for
  the franchise. There is also a strong demand for "one man, one vote." At
  present, while no elector may give more than one vote in any
  constituency, he may, if he has property in various places, give a vote
  in each of these districts, and some men thus give as many as a dozen
  votes at a general election. This plural voting by property and
  residential qualifications in different constituencies is not customary
  in other constitutional countries, and a Bill for its abolition passed
  the House of Commons in 1906, but was rejected by the Lords.</p>

  <p>While Liberals urge "one man, one vote" as the more democratic
  arrangement, Conservatives reply by asking for "one vote, one
  value"&mdash;that is, a new redistribution of seats, for in the last
  twenty-five years there have been deep and extensive changes in the
  distribution of populations, and Ireland in particular is
  over-represented, it is maintained. But then the representation of
  Ireland in the House of Commons was really guaranteed by the Act of
  Union, 1800.<a name="footnotetag85"
  href="#footnote85"><sup>[85]</sup></a></p>

<h4><font class="sc">Working-Class Representation in Parliament</font></h4>

  <p>With the extension of the franchise the change in the <i>personnel</i>
  of the House of Commons has become marked. The more wealthy of the middle
  class entered in considerable numbers after 1832; the Acts of 1867 and
  1884 made the entry of the workman inevitable. The miners were the first
  to send Labour representatives to Parliament, and to-day their members
  outnumber those of any other trade. Since 1892 industrial constituencies,
  chiefly in Yorkshire, Lancashire, South Wales, and the mining districts,
  have gone on steadily electing and re-electing working-class
  representatives&mdash;trade union secretaries and officers for the most
  part&mdash;and with the formation of a National Labour Representation
  Committee in 1900, these representatives became a separate and distinct
  party&mdash;the Labour Party after 1906&mdash;in the House of
  Commons.</p>

  <p>Enfranchisement to secure representation for the redress of grievances
  has been the principle that has guided the English people towards
  democracy. Both the middle class and the working class were convinced
  that enfranchisement was necessary if the House of Commons was to be in
  any real sense a representative assembly, and both have used
  enfranchisement for obtaining representation in Parliament. The return of
  forty Labour Members at recent general elections is evidence that a large
  electorate supports the Labour Party in its desire to carry in Parliament
  legislation that will make life a better thing for the labourer and his
  family; and in the House of Commons the Labour Members have won a general
  respect. As a matter of fact, the House of Commons to-day is in every way
  a more orderly, a more intelligent, more business-like, and
  better-mannered assembly than it was in the days before 1832.</p>

  <p>No stronger evidence of the value of Parliamentary representation to
  the working-class can be offered than the large output of what may be
  called labour legislation in recent years. It is true that Lord
  Shaftesbury's benevolent and entirely disinterested activities promoted
  Factory Acts in the first half of the nineteenth century, but in the last
  twenty years measures for the amelioration of the lot of the workman have
  been constantly before Parliament.</p>

<h4><font class="sc">Removal of Religious Disabilities&mdash;Catholics, Jews, and Freethinkers</font></h4>

  <p>The nineteenth century was not only the century of popular
  enfranchisement; it was the century that saw the removal of religious
  disabilities, and the free admission to Parliament and to the Government
  of Roman Catholics, Nonconformists, Jews, and Freethinkers.</p>

  <p>In the year 1800 Roman Catholics in England were excluded from
  Parliament, from the franchise, from the magistracy, the Bar, the Civil
  Service, from municipal corporations, and from commissions in the Army
  and Navy. Pitt was willing to abolish these disabilities on the passing
  of the Act of Union, and the Irish people were bitterly disappointed that
  the disabilities remained. But George III. refused all assent to the
  proposals, and Pitt resigned. Several times the House of Commons passed
  Catholic Relief Bills, which were thrown out by the Lords, and it was not
  till 1829, when "the English ministry had to choose between concession
  and civil war," that Peel and the Duke of Wellington yielded and
  persuaded their party to admit Catholics to Parliament and to the Civil
  and Military Services.</p>

  <p>The repeal of the Penal Laws against Roman Catholics&mdash;Acts of
  Elizabeth that inflicted penalties on priests who said mass in England,
  and on Roman Catholics who attended mass&mdash;took place in 1844, and in
  1866 the Parliamentary Oath was amended and made unobjectionable to Roman
  Catholics.</p>

  <p>A Roman Catholic is still excluded by law from the Crown, the Lord
  Chancellorship, and the Lord Lieutenancy of Ireland, but many Roman
  Catholics are members of Parliament&mdash;members of all
  parties&mdash;and the late Lord Ripon, a Catholic, sat in a Liberal
  Cabinet.</p>

  <p>In 1846 Rothschild was elected as a Liberal M.P. for the City of
  London, but the law did not permit him to take his seat. Then for some
  years Jewish M.P.'s were allowed to take part in debates and sit on
  committees, but were not allowed to vote. Finally, in 1858, the Lords,
  after rejecting the measure for ten years, passed the Jews' Disabilities
  Bill, which removed all restriction. The Right Hon. Herbert Samuel, M.P.,
  is the first Jew to sit in the Cabinet, for though Disraeli was of the
  Jewish race, he was a Christian in belief.</p>

  <p>Although in 1800 various Acts on the Statute Book required
  Nonconformists to subscribe to the religion of the Church of England
  before taking part in municipal affairs, these Acts had long been a dead
  letter. All that was done in the nineteenth century was to repeal these
  Acts, and to throw open the universities and public offices to
  Nonconformists. It is only, however, in recent years that Nonconformists
  have filled posts of high importance in the Cabinet.</p>

  <p>The last attempt at restriction on the religious beliefs of members of
  Parliament was made in the House of Commons itself, when Charles
  Bradlaugh, after being duly elected M.P. for Northampton, was by the
  action of the House excluded from his seat. Bradlaugh was a frank
  disbeliever in Christianity, and the House of Commons refused to allow
  him either to take the oath or make an affirmation. For five years
  (1880-5) the struggle lasted&mdash;a Liberal Government being in power
  all the time&mdash;and three times during that period the electors of
  Northampton triumphantly returned Charles Bradlaugh as their member, only
  to be answered by resolutions of refusal and expulsion passed by the
  House of Commons against their representative. It was a repetition of the
  battle Wilkes had fought one hundred and twenty years earlier, and it
  ended in the same way. A new Parliament assembled in January, 1886 (after
  a general election in November), the new Speaker (Mr. Peel) permitted
  Bradlaugh to take the oath in the usual way, declined to allow any
  interference, and the battle was over. Two years later a general
  Affirmation Bill was carried on the motion of Bradlaugh, and became law.
  When Charles Bradlaugh lay dying in January, 1891, the House of Commons
  passed, without dissent, a resolution expunging from the journals of the
  House the old resolutions of exclusion.</p>

<h4><font class="sc">The Enfranchisement of Women</font></h4>

  <p>The nineteenth century then will always be noted as the era of steady
  advance towards democracy, especially in England. Enfranchisement of the
  workman, and his representation in Parliament, have transferred the
  government of the country from an aristocracy to the middle class and the
  working class, for to-day, alike in Parliament and in the permanent Civil
  Service, men of the middle class predominate, assisted by those who
  served apprenticeship in mine or workshop. The removal of religious
  disabilities has ended the old rule that confined the business of the
  legislature and the administration of justice to members of the
  Established Church of England, and Roman Catholics, Jews, Nonconformists,
  and Freethinkers now take their share in all public work.</p>

  <p>One disability only remains&mdash;the sex disability that denies the
  parliamentary franchise to women. In the middle ages women were excused
  from parliamentary attendance, but there was no notion that their powers
  and privileges as landowners were shortened because, on account of their
  sex, they were granted exemption from Parliament and from juries. In 1868
  a test case&mdash;Chorlton <i>v.</i> Lings&mdash;was brought, and the
  judges decided that women householders were not to be registered as
  electors, and it was left to Parliament to pass a Women's Enfranchisement
  Bill. From the time of John Stuart Mill's advocacy in 1867 there have
  always been supporters of Women's Suffrage in the House of Commons, and
  in the last five years these supporters have been growing in numbers.
  Only the refusal of the Government to give time for the discussion of the
  Bill in Committee has prevented a Woman's Enfranchisement measure, which
  on several occasions has received a second reading, from passing the
  House of Commons; and the announcement by the present (1911) Government
  that full facilities for such discussion are to be granted next year
  (1912) would indicate that the removal of political sex disabilities is
  close at hand. Women are not asking for adult suffrage, but are willing
  to receive enfranchisement on the terms that qualify men as electors, and
  the Conciliation Bill, as it is called&mdash;because members of every
  political party have agreed to make it their Bill&mdash;would place on
  the roll of electors rather more than a million of women voters.</p>

  <p>Meantime, while waiting for the removal of the anti-democratic barrier
  that excludes them from full political citizenship, women are admitted in
  the United Kingdom to an equal share with men in all local government.
  Since 1869 women who are householders have enjoyed the municipal
  franchise, and as Poor Law guardians and members of school boards, they
  have been freely elected to sit side by side with men. In 1907 women were
  declared eligible by Parliament for membership on county and borough
  councils, and for the chairmanship of county councils and the mayoralty
  of boroughs. Since this Act was passed we have seen women elected to the
  councils of great cities&mdash;Manchester and Liverpool, for
  instance&mdash;and chosen as mayors in several towns. No political
  movement in recent years has been of greater public interest or
  importance than the agitation for "Votes for Women." The demand for
  enfranchisement is based on the old constitutional ground of the
  Parliamentarians of the seventeenth century&mdash;that those who are
  directly taxed by Government must have some political control of the
  public expenditure&mdash;and it is supported by the present leader of the
  Conservative Party<a name="footnotetag86"
  href="#footnote86"><sup>[86]</sup></a> on the ground that government can
  only be carried on in England by consent of the governed.</p>

  <p>The demand for the parliamentary franchise is with us the expression
  of that deep dissatisfaction at the unequal relations of the sexes that
  is felt by many men, and by far more women, all over the civilised world.
  As the middle-class man and the workmen of Great Britain were sure that
  they could not get from Parliament an understanding of popular
  grievances, still less fair treatment, until they possessed the right to
  choose their own parliamentary representatives, so women are convinced
  that there can be no adequate adjustment of these unequal relations until
  they too enjoy the same privilege of citizenship; for enfranchisement and
  representation are the two chosen instruments of democratic government in
  our day.</p>

<h3>DEMOCRACY AT WORK</h3>

<h4><font class="sc">Local Government</font></h4>

  <p>To-day in Great Britain, in America, in the self-governing colonies,
  and in many European countries, we can sec the principles of democracy in
  working order.</p>

  <p>The whole system of local government in Great Britain and Ireland is
  essentially democratic. The municipal councils of all the large cities
  are elected on household suffrage, and have enormous powers. There is now
  no sex disability to prevent the election of women to these bodies, and,
  except in the case of the clergy of the Established Church, who are
  disqualified from sitting on town councils (but not on county or district
  councils), all ratepayers are eligible for nomination. The result is that
  on nearly every city council, and on a great number of county councils,
  London borough councils, urban and rural district councils, boards of
  guardians, and parish councils, there are working-class representatives,
  while women members have been elected to the great councils of Liverpool
  and Manchester, and sit on many boards of guardians and parish
  councils.</p>

  <p>All these councils are of recent creation. The Municipal Corporations
  Act of 1835 placed the election of town councils for the first time in
  the hands of the ratepayers, but the real reform of local government
  dates from 1888. In that year the Conservative Government established
  county and district councils and Lord Rosebery became the first chairman
  of the London County Council. Six years later the Liberals set up parish
  councils in the rural districts, with parish meetings where the
  population did not exceed three hundred. In 1899 the Conservatives
  displaced the old London vestries by borough councils, and in 1902-3
  abolished in England the school boards created in 1870, and made the
  county council the local authority for public elementary education.
  Scotland was allowed to retain its school boards, and strong but
  unsuccessful opposition was made in London and the chief cities to the
  suppression of the specially elected education authority.</p>

  </div>
  <p>As far as rural England is concerned, county councils, district
  councils, and parish councils are, generally speaking, very reluctant to
  put into operation the wide powers they possess. The average county
  council, though popularly elected, is composed in agricultural England of
  landowners and the bigger farmers, who, as a common rule, do not favour a
  land programme for labourers, and are anxious to keep down the rates. The
  rural district council and board of guardians are equally averse from any
  display of public enterprise, and the parish council, which often
  consists mainly of labourers, rarely accomplishes anything except at the
  prompting, or with the sanction, of the parochial landowner. The result
  is that allotments, rural housing, village baths and washhouses, an
  adequate water supply, public halls and libraries, are not regarded as
  the concern of rural elected authorities, but are left to the private
  enterprise of landowners. Civic pride, which glories in the public
  proprietorship of lands and libraries, tramways and lodging-houses,
  waterworks and workmen's dwellings, art galleries and swimming baths, and
  is a living influence in the municipalities of, let us say, London,
  Glasgow, Liverpool, Leeds, Bradford, Manchester, Birmingham, West Ham,
  and many a smaller borough, does not exist in rural councils. To the
  farmer and the peasant public ownership is a new and alien thing. The
  common lands and all the old village communal life have gone out of the
  memory of rural England; but the feudal tradition that the landowner is
  the real centre of authority has survived, and it is the benevolent
  landowner who is expected to build cottages, grant allotments, and see to
  the water supply, as fifty years ago he built and managed the village
  school. Political organisation could break through this tradition, but
  farmers and agricultural labourers are without this organisation; and so
  the authority of the landowner remains, in spite of the democratic
  constitution of local government. The people can allow their power to
  remain in the hands of others, just as a king can be content to reign
  without ruling, and the local government of rural England is an oligarchy
  elected by a popular franchise.</p>

  <p>In the factory towns and the mining districts it is a very different
  matter. Here the people are organised, and take their share in local
  government. In the county of Durham, for instance, the working class
  predominates on local councils, and the influence of trade unions
  prevails in these assemblies wherever a strong Labour party exists. Mr.
  Joseph Chamberlain began his public career on the Birmingham Town
  Council, and his municipal services earned for him the enthusiastic
  support of Birmingham for all his later political ventures. It would be
  difficult to mention the name of a great statesman who laid the
  foundations of his fame in rural local government.</p>

  <p>As in local government, so in the Imperial Parliament. Rural England
  sends no Labour member to the House of Commons. Only in very exceptional
  cases has a tenant farmer been elected. It is the social labour of the
  mine and the mill that has produced the Labour member of Parliament.</p>

  <p>Mr. Joseph Arch made a valiant attempt to organise the agricultural
  labourers of England, and from 1880 to 1890 a rural labourers' union,
  with some thousands of members, was in existence. For a time this secured
  a rise in wages, and when Mr. Arch was in Parliament, as a Liberal M.P.
  (1885-1895), the rural labourer hoped for lasting improvement in the
  conditions of life. But the Union fell to pieces, and Mr. Arch was not
  strong enough single-handed to force the claims of his constituents on
  the House of Commons.</p>

<h4><font class="sc">The Workman in the House of Commons</font></h4>

  <p>To-day there are more than forty workmen in the House of Commons, and
  the great majority of these have served an apprenticeship in municipal
  and trade union offices. Northumberland, Durham, Yorkshire, Lancashire,
  Stafford, South Wales, Glasgow, Dundee, Leicester, Norwich and London,
  all have their elected Labour members in Parliament, and a marked
  preference is shown for the man who has proved his honesty and capacity
  in the municipality, or as the leader of his trade union. All the miners'
  representatives are tried and experienced men. Mr. G.N. Barnes, M.P., was
  for ten years the general secretary of the Amalgamated Society of
  Engineers. Mr. Clynes, M.P., was elected to the office of district
  secretary of the Gas Workers' and General Labourers' Union twenty years
  ago; Mr. Will Thorne, M.P., has been general secretary of the same union
  since 1889, and has sat on the West Ham Corporation for more than sixteen
  years. Mr. George Lansbury, M.P., and Mr. Will Crooks, M.P., are well
  known for their work on the London County Council and on their local
  borough council and board of guardians. Similarly with other Labour
  members of Parliament. Their lives are marked by a sense of public
  responsibility, with the result that in the House of Commons they are
  grave, business-like, and undemonstrative. The Labour members do not make
  "scenes"; they respect the rules of the House and the dignity of the
  National Assembly, partly because they are all in sober middle age, but
  more because they have learnt that public business can only be carried on
  by due observance of order; and they are in Parliament to get business
  done for their constituents, to promote legislation that will make life
  easier for the working class. When Mr. Victor Grayson, in the exuberance
  of youth, and with a passion that blazed out against the misery of the
  poor, made a "scene" in the House of Commons, and was expelled, the
  Labour members were quite sincere in their disapproval. They understood,
  with a wider knowledge than Mr. Grayson possessed, that "scenes"
  alienated sympathy in the House, were not helpful in debate, and were not
  popular with the electors.</p>

  <p>The member who would succeed in the House of Commons must respect the
  usages of the House, and show himself loyal to its laws of debate. As
  long as this respect and loyalty are shown the Labour member is accepted
  by his fellow-members as one who has been elected to the greatest club in
  the world, and is justly entitled to all the privileges of membership.
  For the British House of Commons is a democratic assembly, and in its
  collective pride it cares nothing for the opinions or social rank of its
  members. All it asks is that the newly-elected member should be alive to
  the honour of membership, should be modest in his bearing, and should as
  soon as possible "catch the tone of the House." He may be a labourer, or
  the son of a belted earl; the House is indifferent so long as his
  parliamentary manners are good.</p>

  <p>The House of Commons is a far more orderly assembly than it was a
  hundred years ago; it is more sober and less noisy, and the arrival of
  Labour members has increased rather than diminished its good behaviour.
  It is also a far more industrious assembly, and the influence of the
  Labour party compels an amount of legislation that honourable members
  would have thought impossible fifty years ago.</p>

<h4><font class="sc">Working-class Leaders in Parliament</font></h4>

  <p>Three representative working-class leaders in the House of Commons
  stand out pre-eminently in contemporary politics&mdash;the Right Hon.
  John Burns, Mr. J. Keir Hardie, and Mr. J. Ramsay MacDonald. The Right
  Hon. D. Lloyd George is conspicuous rather as the representative of the
  industrious Nonconformist middle class, but the success of his career is
  no less significant of the advance of democracy. The very Cabinet is now
  no longer an aristocratic committee, and the highest offices of executive
  government are held by men who are neither wealthy nor of distinguished
  family.</p>

  <p>Two working-class leaders of an earlier generation&mdash;the Right
  Hon. T. Burt, M.P., and Mr. H. Broadhurst&mdash;held office as
  Under-Secretaries in the Liberal Government of 1892-5; but Mr. John Burns
  is the first trade unionist to sit in the Cabinet. He, too, might have
  been an Under-Secretary in the days of that short-lived Ministry, but
  decided, with characteristic vigour, that if he was fit to be an
  Under-Secretary he was fit for the Cabinet. At the close of 1905 the
  opportunity came, and the offer of Sir H. Campbell-Bannerman to preside
  over the Local Government Board was promptly accepted. The workman first
  took his place in the Cabinet when Mr. John Burns, at the age of
  forty-seven, went to the Local Government Board&mdash;to the complete
  satisfaction of Mr. Burns. For the robust egoism of Mr. Burns is largely
  a class pride. His invincible belief in himself is part of an equally
  invincible belief in the working class. His ambitions thrive on the
  conviction that whatever Mr. John Burns does, that the working class does
  in the person of their representative. Always does he identify himself
  with the mechanics and labourers with whom his earlier years were spent,
  and by whose support he has risen to office. The more honours for Mr.
  John Burns, the more does it seem to this stalwart optimist that the
  working class is honoured. He arrays himself in court dress at the
  palaces of kings, receives honorary degrees at Universities, and is kept
  before the public by the newspaper paragraphist, without wincing or
  pretending to dislike it. Why should the workman not be esteemed by kings
  and universities? Mr. Burns asks. So great is his self-respect that the
  respect of others is taken as a matter of course. Much of the criticism
  that has been directed against Mr. John Burns misses the mark, because it
  does not recognise that the motive power at work all the time in his
  career is the triumph of his class. It is the triumph of a member of the
  Amalgamated Society of Engineers, of a London workman, that Mr. John
  Burns beholds with unconcealed pleasure in his own success.</p>

  <p>There are drawbacks, of course, to this complete self-satisfaction.
  Since the workman has triumphed in the person of Mr. John Burns, the
  working class would do well to follow his example, and heed his advice on
  all matters affecting its welfare, Mr. Burns argues. The failures of
  working-class life and the misery of the poor are due to the lack of
  those virtues that he possesses, he is apt to maintain. Hence Mr. Burns
  is hated as a Pharisee in certain quarters when he extols self-reliance
  and total abstinence as essential to working-class prosperity, and points
  to gambling and strong drink as the root of all evil in the State. It is
  sometimes urged that Mr. Burns over-praises his own merits; but the fault
  is really in the opposite direction; he does not appreciate sufficiently
  that the gifts he possesses&mdash;the gifts he has used so fully and so
  freely&mdash;are exceptional. These gifts are a powerful physique, a
  great voice, a tremendous energy, and a love of literature; and they are
  not the common equipment of the skilled mechanic and the labourer. True,
  they are often wasted and destroyed when they do exist; and in the case
  of Mr. Burns a strongly disciplined will has made them abundantly
  fruitful. But from the first the physique, the voice, and the untiring
  energy were far above those that fall to the lot of the average workman;
  and the love of books stored the mind with rich supplies of language to
  be drawn upon when speeches were to be made. Not as an administrator at
  the Local Government Board has Mr. Burns become famous. His fame as a
  champion of the working class was established by popular ovations in Hyde
  Park and at dock gates. Battersea has been won and held by the speeches
  of its member. It is not the mighty voice alone, silencing interruption
  often enough by sheer volume of sound, but the plainly pointed epigram,
  the ready jest and the quick repartee that endear Mr. John Burns'
  speeches to the multitude. His sayings and phrases are quoted. His wit is
  the wit of the Londoner&mdash;the wit that Dickens knew and studied, the
  wit of the older cabmen and 'bus drivers, the wit of the street boy. It
  is racy, it is understood, and the illustrations are always concrete and
  massive, never vague or unsubstantial. Apt Shakespearian quotations,
  familiar and unfamiliar, embellish the speeches. Personality, vital
  personality, counts for so much in the orator of the market place. The
  speaker must be alive to his audience, he must convince by his presence
  no less than by his arguments. And Mr. Burns is so obviously alive. He
  warms the shrunken, anæmic vitality of followers, and overpowers the
  protests of enemies by sheer force of character.</p>

  <p>Mr. John Burns is at his real vocation when addressing a great
  multitude. His energy finds an outlet in speech on those occasions, an
  outlet it can never find in the necessary routine of office
  administration. He was made for a life of action, and when once, in
  youth, he had thrown himself into the active study of political and
  industrial questions, every opportunity was seized for stating the
  results of that study. As a Social Democratic candidate for Parliament,
  Mr. Burns polled 598 votes at West Nottingham in 1885. In 1886 he was
  charged (with Messrs. Hyndman, Champion, and Williams) with seditious
  conspiracy&mdash;after an unemployed riot in the West End&mdash;and
  acquitted. In 1887 he suffered six weeks imprisonment (with Mr. R.B.
  Cunninghame Graham) for contesting the right of free speech in Trafalgar
  Square. In 1889 came the great London dock strike, and, with Messrs. Mann
  and Tillett, Mr. Burns was a chief leader of the dockers. Battersea
  returned him to the London County Council in 1889 and to the House of
  Commons in 1892. The Liberal Party promised a wider sphere of work than
  the Socialists could offer; political isolation was a barren business;
  and Mr. Burns gradually passed from the councils of the trade union
  movement to the Treasury Bench of a Liberal Ministry. But the Socialist
  convictions of early manhood had a lasting influence on their owner.
  These convictions have been mellowed by work; responsibility has checked
  and placed under subjection the old revolutionary ardour; experience
  finds the road to a co-operative commonwealth by no means a quick or easy
  route, and admits the necessity of compromise. But there is still a
  consciousness of the working class as a class in the speeches of Mr.
  Burns; and there is still the belief expressed that the working class
  must work out their own salvation, and that it is better the people
  should have the power to manage their own national and municipal affairs,
  and the wisdom to use that power aright, rather than that a benevolent
  bureaucracy should manage things for them. Mr. John Burns is an older man
  by twenty-five years than he was in the stormy days of the Trafalgar
  Square riots, and he is now a Privy Councillor and Cabinet Minister, but
  his character is little changed. His speeches on the settlement of the
  great Dock Strike of August, 1911, are the speeches of the man of 1889.
  Parliamentary life made sharper changes in the minds of Gladstone and Mr.
  Joseph Chamberlain than it has made in the mind of the Right Hon. John
  Burns. But Mr. Burns never admits that he possesses health and vigour
  beyond the average.</p>

  <p>A working class leader of vastly different qualities is Mr. J. Keir
  Hardie, M.P. He, too, no less significant of democracy, stands as the
  representative of his class, claims always to be identified with it, to
  be accepted as its spokesman. A Lanarkshire miner and active trade
  unionist, Mr. Hardie has striven to create a working-class party in
  politics independent of Liberals and Conservatives; to him, more than to
  any other man, the existence of the Independent Labour Party and the
  Parliamentary Labour Party&mdash;the latter consisting of the Independent
  Labour Party and the trade unions&mdash;may justly be said to be due. The
  political independence of an organised working class has been the one
  great idea of Mr. Hardie's public life. Not by any means his only idea,
  for Mr. Hardie has been the ever-ready supporter of all democratic causes
  and the faithful advocate of social reforms; but the <i>great</i> idea,
  the political pearl of great price, for which, if necessary, all else
  must be sacrificed. Only by this independence can democracy be achieved,
  and a more equal state of society be accomplished&mdash;so Mr. Hardie has
  preached to the working people for the last twenty-five years at public
  meetings and trade union congresses, travelling the length and breadth of
  Great Britain in his mission.</p>

  <p>There is something of the poet in Mr. Keir Hardie but much more of the
  prophet, and withal a good deal of shrewd political common sense. Where
  Mr. John Burns wants, humanly, the approval and goodwill of his friends
  and neighbours for his work, Mr. Keir Hardie is content with the
  assurance of his own conscience; and in times of difficulty he chooses
  rather to walk alone, communing with his own heart, than to seek the
  consolations of social intercourse.</p>

  <p>Mr. Burns is a citizen of London, a lover of its streets, at home in
  all its noise, a reveller in its festivities. Mr. Hardie belongs to his
  native land; he is happier on the hills of Lanarkshire than in the
  Parliament of Westminster; solitude has no terrors for him. Both men
  entered the House in 1892. Personal integrity, blameless private life,
  and a doggedness that will not acknowledge defeat, have had much to do
  with the success that both have won. For if Mr. Hardie remains a private
  member of the House of Commons while Mr. Burns is a Cabinet Minister, Mr.
  Hardie has lived to see an independent Labour Party of forty members in
  Parliament, and has himself been its accredited leader.</p>

  <p>Again, exceptional gifts may be noted. An eloquence of speech, a
  rugged sincerity that carries conviction, a love of nature and of
  literature&mdash;all these things, controlled and tempered by will and
  refined by use, have won for Mr. Hardie a high regard and an affection
  for the cause he champions. For years Mr. Hardie was misrepresented in
  the Press, abused by political opponents and misunderstood by many of the
  working class. From 1895 to 1900 he was out of Parliament, rejected by
  the working-class electorate of South West Ham. But nothing turned Mr.
  Hardie from his policy of independence, or shook his faith in the belief
  that only by forming a political party of their own could the working
  people establish a social democracy. Merthyr Tydvil re-elected him to the
  House of Commons in 1900 at the very time when he was braving a strong
  public opinion by denouncing the South African War; and for Merthyr Mr.
  Hardie will sit as long as he is in Parliament.</p>

  <p>It may safely be said that Mr. Hardie will never take office in a
  Liberal Ministry. The sturdy republicanism that keeps him from court
  functions and from the dinner parties of the rich and the great, and the
  strong conviction that Labour members do well to retain simple habits of
  life, are not qualities that impel men to join Governments.</p>

  <p>Visionary as he is&mdash;and no less a visionary because he has seen
  some fulfilment of his hopes&mdash;so indifferent to public opinion that
  many have exclaimed at his indiscretions, with a religious temperament
  that makes him treat his political work as a solemn calling of God and
  gives prophetic fire to his public utterances, Mr. Keir Hardie may remain
  a private member of Parliament; but he also remains an outstanding figure
  in democratic politics, conspicuous in an age that has seen the working
  class rising cautiously to power. Mr. Hardie's influence with the
  politically minded of the working class has contributed in no small
  degree to the changes that are now at work. The ideal of a working class,
  educated and organised, taking up the reins of government and using its
  power in sober righteousness, has been preached by Mr. Hardie with a
  fervour that commands respect. He has made an appeal that has moved the
  hearts of men and women by its religious note, and hence it is very
  considerably from the ranks of Nonconformists with Puritan traditions
  that the Independent Labour Party has been recruited. Mr. Hardie is now
  fifty-five years of age. He has never been afraid of making mistakes, and
  he has never sought the applause of men. He has succeeded in arousing
  large numbers of people from a passive allegiance to the party
  governments of Liberals and Conservatives, and constrained them to march
  under a Labour banner at political contests. Whether the Labour Party in
  Parliament will remain a separate organisation or will steadily become
  merged in the Liberal Party, forming perhaps a definite left wing of that
  party: whether a sufficiently large number of voters will ever be found
  to make the Labour Party anything more than a group in Parliament: and
  whether the Independent Labour movement is not passing as Robert Owen's
  socialist movement and as the Chartist movement passed away in the middle
  of the nineteenth century, are questions that are yet to be answered.
  Democracy will go its own way in spite of the prophets. In any case, the
  work of Mr. Keir Hardie has been fruitful and valuable. For it has made
  for a quickened intelligence, and a more exalted view of human life
  amongst the working people; and it has increased the sense of personal
  and civic responsibility. It has made for civilisation, in fact, and it
  has insisted on the importance of things that democracy can only forget
  to its own destruction.</p>

  <p>The third distinguished working-class leader in Parliament is Mr. J.
  Ramsay MacDonald, the elected leader of the Labour Party, and its
  secretary since its formation. Mr. Ramsay MacDonald is for the working
  class, but, though born of labouring people, and educated in a Scotch
  board school, has long ceased to be of them. Never a workman, and never
  associated with the workman's trade union, Mr. MacDonald went from school
  teaching to journalism and to a political private secretaryship, and so
  settled down quickly into the habits and customs of the ruling middle
  class. Marriage united him still more closely with the middle class, and
  strengthened his position by removing all fear of poverty, and providing
  opportunities for travel.</p>

  <p>From the first Mr. MacDonald's political life has been directed
  clearly to one end&mdash;the assumption of power to be used for the
  social improvement of the people. And this ambition has carried him far,
  and may carry him farther. With the industry and persistence that are
  common to his race, Mr. MacDonald has taken every means available to
  educate himself on all political questions; with the result that he is
  accepted to-day as one of the best informed members of the House of
  Commons. He taught himself to speak, and his speeches are appreciated. He
  taught himself to write, and his articles on political questions have
  long been welcome in the monthly reviews, and his books on Socialism are
  widely read. Twenty years ago the Liberal Party promised no political
  career to earnest men like Mr. MacDonald, men anxious for social reform.
  The future seemed to be with the Socialists, and with the Independent
  Labour Party. When the Liberal downfall came in 1895, it was thought that
  the fortunes of Liberalism were ended. Native prudence has restrained Mr.
  Ramsay MacDonald from pioneering, but once the Independent Labour Party,
  of Mr. Keir Hardie's desire, was set going, and promised an effectual
  means for political work, Mr. MacDonald joined it, and did well to do so.
  As an ordinary Liberal or Radical Member of Parliament, Mr. Ramsay
  MacDonald would never have had the opportunities the Labour Party has
  given him. He only entered the House of Commons in 1906&mdash;at the age
  of forty&mdash;and already as leader of the Labour Party he is a
  distinguished Parliamentary figure, of whose future great things are
  foretold.</p>

  <p>Mr. MacDonald has studied politics as other people study art or
  science. He has trained himself to become a statesman as men and women
  train themselves to become painters and musicians. He has learnt the
  rules of the game, marked the way of failure and the road to success, and
  his career may be pondered as an example to the young. No generous
  outburst of wrath disfigures Mr. MacDonald's speeches, no rash utterance
  is ever to be apologised for, no hasty impulse to be regretted. In the
  Labour movement Mr. MacDonald won success over older men by an
  indefatigable industry, a marked aptitude for politics, and by an obvious
  prosperity. Other things being equal, it is inevitable that in politics,
  as in commerce, the needy, impecunious man will be rejected in favour of
  the man with an assured balance at the bank, and the man of regular
  habits preferred before a gifted but uncertain genius. The Socialist and
  Labour movements of our time have claimed the services of many gifted men
  and women, and the annals of these movements are full of heroic
  self-sacrifice. But an aptitude for politics was not a distinguishing
  mark of Socialists, and therefore Mr. MacDonald's experience and
  abilities gave him at once a prominent place in the council of the
  Independent Labour Party, and soon made him the controlling power in that
  organisation. With the formation of the National Labour Party a very much
  wider realm was to be conquered, and Mr. MacDonald has been as successful
  here as in the earlier Independent Labour Party. But now the Labour Party
  having made Mr. MacDonald its chairman, it can do no more for him. He is
  but forty-five years old, his health is good, his talents are recognised;
  by his aversion from everything eccentric or explosive, the public have
  understood that he is trustworthy. We may expect to see Mr. Ramsay
  MacDonald a Cabinet Minister in a Liberal-Labour Government. It may even
  happen that he will become Prime Minister in such a Government. He is a
  "safe" man, without taint of fanaticism. His sincerity for the
  improvement of the lot of the poor does not compel him to extravagant
  speech on the subject, and his imagination is sufficient to exclude
  dullness of view. He has proved that the application of Socialist
  principles does not require any violent disturbance of the existing
  order, and is compatible with social respectability and political
  authority. A public opinion that would revolt against the notion of an
  ex-workman becoming Prime Minister would not be outraged in any way by
  Mr. MacDonald holding that office. Mr. Burns and Mr. Hardie have remained
  in their own and in the public eye representatives of the working class,
  all education notwithstanding. Mr. MacDonald has long cut himself off
  from the labouring class of his boyhood. He has adapted himself easily
  and naturally to the life and manners of the wealthier professional
  classes, and he moves without constraint in the social world of high
  politics, as one born to the business. No recognition of the workman is
  possible in Mr. Ramsay MacDonald's case, and this fact is greatly in his
  favour with the multitudes who still hold that England should be ruled by
  "gentlemen."</p>

  <p>The Right Hon. D. Lloyd George is a striking figure in our new
  democracy, and his character and position are to be noted. It was not as
  a labour representative but as the chosen mouthpiece of the working
  middle class, enthusiastic for Welsh nationalism, that Mr. Lloyd George
  entered Parliament in 1890, at the age of twenty-seven. With his entry
  into the Cabinet, in company with Mr. John Burns, at the Liberal revival
  in 1905, government by aristocracy was ended; and when Mr. Lloyd George
  went from the Board of Trade to the Chancellorship of the Exchequer,
  startling changes were predicted in national finance. These predictions
  were held to have been fulfilled in the Budget of 1909. The House of
  Lords considered the financial proposals of the Budget so revolutionary
  that it took the unprecedented course of rejecting the Bill, and thus
  precipitated the dispute between the two Houses of Parliament, which was
  brought to a satisfactory end by the Parliament Act of 1911. Romantic and
  idealist from the first, and with unconcealed ambition and considerable
  courage, Mr. Lloyd George, with the strong backing of his Welsh
  compatriots, fought his way into the front rank of the Liberal Party
  during the ten years (1895-1905) of opposition. More than once Mr. George
  pitted himself against Mr. Joseph Chamberlain in the days of the
  Conservative ascendancy and the South African War, and his powers as a
  Parliamentary debater won general acknowledgment. In youth Mr. Lloyd
  George, full of the fervour of Mazzini's democratic teaching, dreamed of
  Wales as a nation, a republic, with himself, perhaps, as its first
  president. Welsh nationalism could not breed a Home Rule Party as Irish
  nationalism has done, and Mr. Lloyd George has found greater scope for
  his talents in the Liberal Party. The Welsh "question" has dwindled into
  a campaign for the Disestablishment of the Church in Wales, a warfare of
  Dissenters and Churchmen, and to Mr. Lloyd George there were bigger
  issues at stake than the position of the Welsh Church.</p>

  </div>
  <p>Already Mr. Lloyd George's Budget and his speeches in support of the
  Budget have made the name of the Chancellor of the Exchequer familiar to
  the people of Great Britain; and now, in the eager discussion on his Bill
  for National Insurance, that name is still more loudly spoken. Hated by
  opponents and praised by admirers, denounced and extolled, Mr. Lloyd
  George enjoys the tumult he arouses. His passionate speeches for the poor
  provoke the sympathy of the working class; his denunciations of the rich
  stir the anger of all who fear social revolution. Hostile critics deny
  any constructive statesmanship in Mr. Lloyd George's plans and orations,
  and prophesy a short-lived tenure of office. Radical supporters hail him
  as a saviour of society, and are confident that under his leadership
  democracy will enter the promised land of peace and prosperity for all.
  Neutral minds doubt whether Mr. Lloyd George is sufficiently
  well-balanced for the responsibilities of high office, and express
  misgivings lest the era of social reform be inaugurated too rapidly. The
  obvious danger of a fall always confronts ambition in politics, but the
  danger is only obvious to the onlooker. Pressing forward the legislative
  measures he has set his heart upon, and impatient to carry out the policy
  that seems to him of first importance to the State, Mr. Lloyd George pays
  little heed to the criticism of friends or foes. A supreme
  self-confidence carries him along, and the spur of ambition is constantly
  pricking. Political co-operation is difficult for such a man, and an
  indifference to reforms that are not of his initiation, and a willingness
  to wreck legislation that cannot bear his name, are a weakness in Mr.
  Lloyd George that may easily produce a fall. Only a very strong man can
  afford to say that a reform shall be carried in his way, or not at all,
  in cheerful disregard of the wishes of colleagues and followers. Mr.
  Lloyd George's attitude on the question of Women's Suffrage is
  characteristic. Professing a strong belief in the justice of women's
  enfranchisement, he assumes that he can safely oppose all Women's
  Suffrage Bills that are not of his framing, even when these Bills are the
  work of ardent Liberals. He would have the measure postponed until he
  himself can bring in a Reform Bill, to the end that the enfranchisement
  of women may be associated with his name for all time.</p>

  <p>It is dangerous to the statesman, the ambition that finds satisfaction
  less in the success of a party or the triumph of a cause, than in the
  personal victory. Dangerous, because it brings with it an isolation from
  friends and colleagues. These come to stand coldly aloof, and then, if a
  slip occurs or a mistake is made, and there comes a fall, no hands are
  stretched out to repair the damage or restore the fallen. The statesman
  who is suspected of "playing for his own hand" may laugh at the murmurs
  of discontent amongst his followers while all goes well for him, but when
  he falls he falls beyond recovery. No one can foretell the end of Mr.
  Lloyd George's career, but his popularity with the multitude will not
  make up to him for the want of support in Parliament should an error of
  judgment undo him. The pages of political history are strewn with the
  stories of high careers wrecked in a feverish haste for fame, that
  overlooked dangers close at hand; of eminent politicians broken in the
  full course of active life by the mere forgetfulness of the existence of
  other persons. A simple miscalculation of forces, and from lofty station
  a minister tumbles into the void.</p>

  <p>The stability of the working-class leaders makes their future a matter
  of fairly safe conjecture. Mr. Lloyd George, romantic in temperament,
  covetous of honour, confident of popularity, but heedless of good-will
  alienated and of positive ill-will created, has reached the
  Chancellorship of the Exchequer. Will he climb still higher in office, or
  will he pass to the limbo peopled by those who were and are not? Time
  alone can tell. But in this year of grace 1911 Mr. Lloyd George,
  incarnation of the hard-working middle class, is a very distinct
  personality in the government of the country, and his presence in the
  Cabinet a fact in the history of democracy.</p>

<h4><font class="sc">The Present Position of the House of Lords</font></h4>

  <p>More than once since 1831 the House of Lords has come into conflict
  with the House of Commons when a Liberal Government has been in power. A
  compromise was effected between the two Houses over the Disestablishment
  of the Irish Church in 1869, the Lords, on the whole, giving way. When
  the Lords proposed to "amend" the Army Reform Bill (for abolishing the
  purchase of commissions) in 1871, Gladstone overpowered their opposition
  by advising the Crown to cancel the Royal Warrant which made purchase
  legal, and to issue a new warrant ending the sale of commissions. This
  device completely worsted the House of Lords, for a refusal to pass the
  Bill under the circumstances merely deprived the holders of commissions
  of the compensation awarded in the Bill. The Army Reform Bill became law,
  but strong objection was taken by many Liberals to the sudden exercise of
  the Royal Prerogative. In 1884 the Lords refused to pass the Bill for the
  enfranchisement of the rural labourer unless a Bill was brought in at the
  same time for a redistribution of seats. After some discussion Gladstone
  yielded, the Redistribution Bill was drawn up, and passed the Commons
  simultaneously with the Franchise Bill in the Lords.</p>

  <p>Several Bills have been rejected or "amended" by the Lords since the
  Liberals came into power in 1906, and the crisis came when the Budget was
  rejected in 1909. In June, 1907, the following resolution was passed by
  the House of Commons by 432 to 147 votes: "That in order to give effect
  to the will of the people, as expressed by their elected representatives,
  it is necessary that the power of the other House to alter or reject
  Bills passed by this House should be so restricted by law as to secure
  that within the limits of a single Parliament the final decision of the
  Commons shall prevail." This resolution was embodied in the Parliament
  Bill of 1911. Between 1907 and 1911 came (1) the rejection of the Budget,
  November, 1909; (2) the General Election of January, 1910, and the return
  of a majority of 124 (Liberal, Labour, and Irish Nationalist) in support
  of the Government; (3) the passing of resolutions (majority, 105) for
  limiting the Veto of the Lords; (4) the failure of a joint Conference
  between leading Liberals and Conservatives on the Veto question, followed
  by (5) the General Election of December, 1910, and the return of the
  Liberals with a united majority of 126.</p>

  <p>The Parliament Bill declared that every Money Bill sent up by the
  Commons, if not passed unamended by the Lords within a month, should
  receive the Royal assent and become an Act of Parliament notwithstanding,
  and that every Bill sent up for three successive sessions shall in the
  third session become an Act of Parliament without the assent of the
  Lords.</p>

  <p>The Lords passed this Bill with amendments which the Commons refused
  to accept, and the Parliament Bill was returned to the Lords in August.
  But, as in 1832, the Prime Minister announced that he had received
  guarantees from the Crown that peers should be created to secure the
  passage of the Bill if it was again rejected; and to avoid the making of
  some three or four hundred Liberal peers, Lord Lansdowne&mdash;following
  the example of the Duke of Wellington&mdash;advised the Conservatives in
  the House of Lords to refrain from opposition. The result of this
  abstention was that the Lords' amendments were not persisted in, and the
  Bill passed the Lords on August 10th, 1911, by 131 to 114 votes.</p>

  <p>By this Parliament Act the Lords' veto is now strictly limited. The
  Lords may reject a Bill for two sessions, but if the Commons persist,
  then the Bill passes into law, whether the Lords approve or
  disapprove.</p>

  <p>The real grievance against the House of Lords, from the democratic
  standpoint, has been that its veto was only used when a Liberal
  government was in power. There is not even a pretence by the Upper House
  of revising the measures sent from the Commons by a Conservative
  ministry; yet over and over again, and especially in the last five years,
  Liberal measures have been rejected, or "amended" against the will of the
  Commons, by the Lords after the electors have returned the Liberals to
  power. The permanent and overwhelming Conservative majority in the Lords
  acts on the assumption that a Liberal ministry does not represent the
  will of the people, an assumption at variance with the present theory of
  democratic government, and in contradiction to the constitutional
  practice of the Crown. The great size of the House of Lords makes the
  difficulty of dealing with this majority so acute. In 1831 the creation
  of forty peerages would have been sufficient to meet the Tory opposition
  to the Reform Bill; to-day it is said that about four hundred are
  required to give the Liberals a working majority in the Lords. The rapid
  making of peers began under George III., but from 1830 to the present day
  Prime Minister after Prime Minister has added to the membership of the
  House of Lords with generous hand. Satire, savage and contemptuous, has
  been directed against the new peers by critics of various opinions, but
  still the work of adding to the House of hereditary legislators goes
  gaily on, and Liberal Prime Ministers have been as active as their Tory
  opponents in adding to the permanent Conservative majority in the Lords;
  for only a small minority of Liberal peers retain their allegiance to the
  Liberal Party.</p>

  <p>Thackeray gave us his view of the making of peers in the years when
  Lord Melbourne and his Whig successors were steadily adding to the Upper
  House. (Between 1835 and 1841 Melbourne made forty-four new peers, and
  twenty-eight more were added by 1856.)</p>

  <p>"A man becomes enormously rich, or he jobs successfully in the aid of
  a Minister, or he wins a great battle, or executes a treaty, or is a
  clever lawyer who makes a multitude of fees and ascends the bench; and
  the country rewards him for ever with a gold coronet (with more or less
  balls or leaves) and a title, and a rank as legislator. 'Your merits are
  so great,' says the nation, 'that your children shall be allowed to reign
  over us, in a manner. It does not in the least matter that your eldest
  son is a fool; we think your services so remarkable that he shall have
  the reversion of your honours when death vacates your noble shoes.'"</p>

  <p>J.H. Bernard, in his "Theory of the Constitution" (1835), was no less
  emphatic:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"As the affair is managed now, the peerage, though sometimes bestowed
  as the reward of merit, on men who have adorned particular professions,
  is yet much more frequently&mdash;nine times out of ten&mdash;employed by
  the minister of the day as his instrument to serve particular views of
  public policy; and is often given to actual demerit&mdash;to men who hire
  themselves out to do his commands through thick and thin. The peerage is
  now full of persons who have obtained possession of it by disreputable
  means."</p>

  <p>But in spite of satire and hostile criticism members of the House of
  Lords have always enjoyed a considerable social popularity. They are
  widely esteemed for their titles, even by those who denounce hereditary
  legislators and desire to abolish the Second Chamber.</p>

  <p>Disraeli created six new peers in 1867-8, and seventeen more from 1875
  to 1880, in addition to conferring the earldom of Beaconsfield on
  himself. Yet Disraeli had written in "Coningsby" (1844):&mdash;</p>

  <p>"We owe the English peerage to three sources: the spoliation of the
  Church, the open and flagrant sale of its honours by the elder Stuarts,
  and the borough-mongering of our own times. Those are the three main
  sources of the existing peerage of England, and, in my opinion,
  disgraceful ones."</p>

  <p>Gladstone made fifty peers in his four premierships, and Mr. Herbert
  Paul, the Liberal historian of "Modern England," makes the following
  comments:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"No minister since Pitt had done so much as Mr. Gladstone to enlarge
  and thereby to strengthen the House of Lords.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Gladstone was lavish in his distribution of peerages, and rich
  men who were politically active, either in the House of Commons or behind
  the scenes, might hope to be rewarded with safe seats elsewhere."</p>

    <h4>THE PASSING OF THE PARLIAMENT BILL IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS</h4>

    <i>From the Drawing by S. Begg.</i>
  </div>
  <p>Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman exceeded all previous records of the last
  century by making twenty new peers in less than two years&mdash;1905 to
  1907&mdash;and Mr. Asquith maintained this vigorous policy by thirteen
  new creations in the first year of his premiership. Already many of these
  peers, whose titles are not more than six years old, vote with the
  Conservatives. Great Britain is now the only country in the world that
  combines a democratic form of government with a second chamber of
  hereditary legislators, and many proposals are on foot for the reform of
  the House of Lords. While the Conservatives are more anxious to change
  the constitution of the Upper House, and to make it a stronger and more
  representative assembly, the Liberals prefer that its power of veto
  should be abolished. No Act of Parliament was required to abolish the
  veto of the Crown on Acts of Parliament, but the growth of a democratic
  public opinion did not prove strong enough to end the veto of the Lords
  on the Bills passed by a Liberal majority in the Commons, and therefore
  the Parliament Act was passed.</p>

<h4><font class="sc">The Popularity of the Crown</font></h4>

  <p>The popularity of the Crown has become increasingly wider and more
  general in the years that have seen the British people steadily taking up
  the work of self-government. The fear of a hostile demonstration by the
  inhabitants of London kept William IV. from visiting the Mansion House in
  1830, and the death of that monarch in 1837 evoked no national mourning.
  Queen Victoria, unknown to the people on her accession, had the very
  great advantage of Lord Melbourne's political advice in the early years
  of her reign. Her marriage, in 1840, with the Prince Consort&mdash;who
  himself learnt much from Melbourne&mdash;brought a wise counsellor to the
  assistance of the throne. "I study the politics of the day with great
  industry," wrote the Prince Consort. "I speak quite openly to the
  Ministers on all subjects, and endeavour quietly to be of as much use to
  Victoria as I can." The Prince Consort saw quickly that "if monarchy was
  to rise in popularity, it could only be by the sovereign leading a good
  life, and keeping quite aloof from party." The days of a profligate court
  and of "the King's friends" in politics were past and gone; the royal
  <i>influence</i> was to succeed the royal <i>prerogative</i>.<a
  name="footnotetag87" href="#footnote87"><sup>[87]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The aloofness from political partisanship has been faithfully
  maintained by the successors of Queen Victoria, and great as the royal
  influence may be in the social life of the wealthier classes, it is
  certain that no such influence operates in the casting of votes by the
  people at Parliamentary elections. No one suspects the King of desiring
  the return of Liberals over Tories, or of favouring the Tory programme
  rather than the Liberal; and this neutrality is the surest guarantee of
  the continued popularity of the Crown.</p>

  <p>For some years in the late 'seventies and early 'eighties of the
  nineteenth century Republicanism was the creed of many ardent
  working-class Radicals in England. Charles Bradlaugh was its chief
  exponent, and both Mr. Joseph Chamberlain and the late Sir Charles Dilke
  were regarded as Republicans before they entered Gladstone's Ministry in
  1880. The Republican movement waned before Bradlaugh's death. He himself
  was "led to feel that agitation for an ideal form of government was less
  directly fruitful than agitation against the abuses of class privilege;
  and in the last dozen years of his life, his political work went mainly
  to reforms within the lines of the Constitution."<a name="footnotetag88"
  href="#footnote88"><sup>[88]</sup></a></p>

  <p>With the rise of the Socialist movement in England in 1884-5, and the
  celebration of the Queen's Jubilee in 1887, Republicanism became utterly
  moribund, and nothing save an attempt on the part of the sovereign to
  take a definite side in party politics, or a notorious lapse from the
  morals required of persons in office of State, could revive it.</p>

  <p>The interest in Socialism was fatal to the Republican movement,
  because it turned the enthusiasm of the active spirits in democratic
  politics from the desire for radical changes in the <i>form</i> of
  government, to the crusade for economic changes, and the belief in a
  coming social revolution. The existence of monarchy seemed a small and
  comparatively unimportant affair to men and women who were hoping to get
  poverty abolished, and the landlords and capitalists expropriated either
  by direct revolution, or by the act of a House of Commons, dominated by
  working men with Socialist convictions.</p>

  <p>The national celebrations at the Queen's Jubilee in 1887 marked the
  beginning of the popular revival in pageantry and official ceremonial. In
  the Church of England this revival began some forty years earlier, and it
  has, in our day, changed the whole conduct of public worship. The revival
  of Roman Catholicism in England with its processions and solemn ritual
  has been equally significant. By gratifying the common human instinct for
  spectacle and drama the monarchy has gained the popular affections.</p>

  <p>The Whigs scoffed at pageants and symbols; the earlier Puritans had
  proscribed ceremonial as savouring of idolatry, and feared any
  manifestation of beauty as a snare of the devil. In the latter half of
  the nineteenth century, England began to throw off the shackles of
  Puritanism, and to lose all interest in Whiggery. The new democracy was
  neither coldly Deist, nor austerely Republican. It has shown no
  inclination to inaugurate a reign of "pure reason" in religion or
  politics, but has boldly and cheerfully adopted symbolism and pageantry.
  Friendly societies and trade unions have their badges, banners, and
  buttons. The Roman Catholic Church grows in popularity with the working
  class, and in many towns and cities the Church of England and the
  Salvation Army are distinctly popular. On the other hand, the
  Nonconformist churches confess annually to a decreasing membership, and
  Secularist and Ethical societies have but the smallest following.</p>

  <p>The royal processions and the pageantry of monarchy have provided a
  spectacular display that average human nature enjoys. The symbols and
  trappings of monarchy must be shown if the sovereign is to be popular;
  they add to the gaiety of life, and people are grateful for the warmth of
  colour they impart to our grey streets. The sovereign in encouraging the
  renewed and growing love for pageants and ceremonial has discerned the
  signs of the times. Modern democracy does not desire that kings or
  priests shall rule; but it does require that they shall on State
  occasions and in the performance of their office, be clad in kingly and
  priestly robes, and by their proceedings enrich the dignity of public
  life, and the beauty of public worship.</p>

<h4><font class="sc">The Democratic Ideals: Socialism and Social Reform</font></h4>

  <p>The rise of Socialism in the 'eighties not only diverted the attention
  of working-class leaders from political reform, but it substituted for
  the destruction of monarchy and the House of Lords a reconstruction of
  society as the goal of democracy; and the Socialist teaching has been of
  enduring and penetrating influence.</p>

  <p>Fifty years earlier in the nineteenth century, Robert Owen had
  preached a Socialist crusade with strenuous persuasion&mdash;but,
  ignoring politics, he outlived the temporary success of his cause. The
  utopian Socialism of Owen flourished and died, as Chartism, under
  different treatment, flourished and died.</p>

  <p>The "scientific" Socialism of Karl Marx was planned on stronger
  foundations. It brought a message of hope; it revealed how the change was
  to be wrought that would "emancipate the workers of the world from the
  slavery of wage service"; and it insisted that this change was
  inevitable. On the Continent, and more particularly in Germany, the
  Social Democratic Party has gained an enormous working-class support, and
  every election adds to its strength.</p>

  <p>In England the Social Democratic Federation&mdash;now the Social
  Democratic Party&mdash;was founded in 1884 by Mr. H.M. Hyndman; but in
  spite of its untiring efforts, it has never won the sympathy of the trade
  unions, nor the confidence of the working-class electorate. Its
  Parliamentary candidatures rarely attract attention, and it is not a
  force in Labour politics. Nevertheless, indirectly, the influence of the
  Social Democratic Party has been very considerable. Mr. John Burns, and
  many another Labour leader, have passed through its ranks, and a social
  conscience has been made sensitive to the miseries of the poor, largely
  by the voices&mdash;that will not be silenced&mdash;of this comparatively
  small company.</p>

  <p>The Fabian Society also began its work of educating public opinion to
  Socialism in 1884, but, unlike the Social Democratic Federation, it made
  no proposals for the creation of a Socialist Party or the organisation of
  the working class into a separate political party. Mainly, its influence
  can be seen in the increase of statistical knowledge and of State
  interference in the conditions of life and labour in the working
  class.</p>

  <p>The Independent Labour Party was not formed till 1892, and while
  professing Socialism, it has aimed rather at securing the return of
  labour members to Parliament, and to local governing councils than at the
  conversion of the working class to a dogmatic social democracy. Often
  frankly opportunist and experimental, the Independent Labour Party and
  its offspring, the Labour Party in the House of Commons, have followed
  the national custom in politics of attacking and redressing evident
  evils, and have done this with considerable success.</p>

  <p>But while the Socialists have compelled the attention of all classes
  to existing social ills, and have made social reform the chief concern of
  all politicians, the idea of a social democracy steadily recedes from the
  political vision, and the conscious movement to Socialism falters.
  Socialist workmen in Parliament or on city councils soon find themselves
  absorbed in the practical work of legislation or administration, and
  learn that there is neither leisure nor outlet for revolutionary
  propaganda. The engrossing character of public work destroys the old
  inclination to break up the existing order, for the Socialist member of
  Parliament, or city councillor interested in his work, has become part of
  the machinery responsible for the existing order, and without losing his
  sympathy for the labouring people is content that the amelioration of
  society shall come, as it now seems to him it must come, by slow and
  orderly stages and without violence. The very return of so many Labour
  members to Parliament and to local councils has damped down the fires of
  Socialism, by placing in positions of authority and responsibility, and
  thereby withdrawing them from the army of disaffection, the ablest
  leaders of the working-class movement. The Labour member who cannot
  settle down to legislative or administrative work, but attempts to play
  the agitator's part in the House of Commons or the council chamber, is
  generally doomed to banishment from official public life, and is allowed
  to remain an agitator.</p>

  <p>Mr. John Burns may be denounced as a renegade by Socialist critics,
  but a working-class electorate returns him to Parliament. Mr. Cunninghame
  Graham and Mr. Victor Grayson may be applauded for their consistency by
  Socialist audiences, but working-class constituencies are loth to return
  such representatives to the House of Commons.</p>

  <p>As Socialism quietly passes out of the vision of the political world,
  and from a definite inspiration to democracy becomes a dim and remote
  possibility of the future, Social Reform takes its place. Not only in
  Great Britain, but throughout Europe, the social reformers or
  "revisionists" are gaining the mastery over the scientific Marxian
  Socialists in democratic politics. In Great Britain where "practical," or
  experimental, politics have always prevailed over political theory, the
  passing of positive Socialist dogma is naturally more obvious. Social
  Reform is now the cry of Liberals and Conservatives alike. The old
  Liberal doctrines of <i>laissez faire</i>, unrestricted competition, and
  the personal liberty of the subject are as dead as the Stuart doctrine of
  the divine right of kings. The old Liberal hostility to State
  interference in trade or commerce, and to compulsory social legislation
  has melted away at the awakened social conscience. It still has its
  adherents&mdash;Lord Cromer and Mr. Harold Cox repeat the ancient
  watch-words of Victorian Liberalism, and they are regarded with a respect
  mingled with curiosity, as strange survivals of a far-off age&mdash;but
  no popular echo follows their utterances. Pensions for the aged, better
  provision for the sick and the infirm, a more careful attention to the
  well-being of children, national health, some cure for destitution, and
  some remedy for unemployment&mdash;these are the matters that a Liberal
  Government is concerned about to-day. And the Conservatives are no less
  sincere in their willingness to help in these matters. Legislative
  proposals for social reform are treated as non-party questions, and the
  chief item in the Conservative programme, Tariff Reform, was adopted and
  is advocated mainly as a social reform, a cure for industrial evils, and
  the misery of unemployment.</p>

  <p>Socialism proposed the abolition of poverty, and the common ownership
  and control of the land and the means of production, distribution, and
  exchange as the solution of economic questions.</p>

  <p>Social Reform proposes to mitigate the hardships of life for the
  multitude, and, while leaving land and capital in private hands, to
  compel by taxation provision for the wants of the people. Its aim is the
  abolition of destitution by State assistance to voluntary effort, and the
  gradual raising of the standard of life. It does not propose to remove
  the cause of poverty.</p>

  <p>Socialism would place the democracy in possession of the means of
  wealth. Social Reform requires the State to tax wealth and provide for
  the people. It promises a living wage, decent housing accommodation, an
  insurance against unemployment, and security in old age, and leaves the
  question of national ownership or private ownership to be settled by
  posterity.</p>

<h4><font class="sc">Land Reform and the Single Tax</font></h4>

  <p>Apart from the ideals of Socialism, the democratic ideal of a
  community owning the full value of its land was presented by Henry
  George, an American economist, in 1879, and his book "Progress and
  Poverty," was at once received with enthusiasm by certain reformers in
  England and America. George visited England in 1881, 1884, and 1889, and
  his visits resulted in a strong movement for the taxation of land values.
  This movement has been inspired by an ideal of a democratic community as
  definite as the Socialist ideal, and it has grown steadily in popular
  favour as the justice of a tax on land values has been recognised.
  "Progress and Poverty" is the bible of the Land Reformers, as Marx's
  "Capital" is (or was) the bible of Socialists. It is claimed that a tax
  on land values is the true remedy of social and economic ills, and that
  democracy can eradicate the root-cause of poverty by such a tax. In this
  belief the followers of Henry George have preached the Single Tax, as it
  is called, with unquenchable fervour, and the Liberal Party has been
  gradually won over&mdash;if not to the Single Tax, at least to a tax on
  land values. Many Conservatives, too, favour the taxation of land values
  in cities, and all the principal municipalities have petitioned
  Parliament in favour of this method of taxation. But it is the democratic
  ideals of Henry George that have been the life of the movement for the
  Single Tax, and but for these ideals the movement would never have become
  a living influence towards democracy, or inspired a social
  enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>The charm about the Single Tax propaganda is that its ideals of
  democracy do not discourage the practical politician and the average
  citizen from supporting what seems a necessary and reasonable proposal.
  Without committing themselves at all to Henry George's full scheme for
  the total abolition of land monopoly by a tax of twenty shillings in the
  pound on all land values, and without abandoning the common British
  suspicion of the doctrinaire and the political idealist, the ordinary
  shopkeeper and householder are quite of opinion that urban values in land
  can be taxed legitimately for the benefit of the community, and that
  democracy would do well to decree some moderate tax on land values for
  the relief of the overtaxed non-landowner.</p>

  <p>So the taxation of land values is presented by its advocates as a
  social reform more radical and democratic than all other social reforms,
  as a reform that in fact would make democracy master of its own land, and
  the people free from the curse of poverty; and it is accepted by the
  great mass of working people as a just and useful method of raising
  revenue for local and imperial needs.</p>

  <p>Socialism, social reform, the Single Tax&mdash;various are the ideals
  of a democratic people at work at the business of government, and various
  are the means proposed to establish the democracy in economic
  freedom.</p>

<h3>THE WORLD-WIDE MOVEMENT: ITS STRENGTH AND
WEAKNESS</h3>

<h4><font class="sc">East and West</font></h4>

  <p>The movement towards democracy is world-wide to-day, and the political
  constitutions of the West are desired with fervour in the East.</p>

  <p>For generations there has been agitation in Russia for representative
  government, and men and women&mdash;in countless numbers&mdash;have
  sacrificed wealth, reputation, liberty, and life itself in the cause of
  political freedom. On the establishment in 1906 of the Duma, a national
  chamber of elected members, there was general rejoicing, because it
  seemed that, at length, autocracy was to give place to representative
  government. But the hopes of the political reformers were short lived.
  The Duma still exists, but its powers were closely restricted in 1907,
  and the franchise has been narrowed, to secure an overwhelming
  preponderance of the wealthy, so that it is altogether misleading to
  regard it as a popular assembly.</p>

  <p>In Egypt and in India the Nationalist movements are directed to
  self-government, and are led by men who have, in most cases, spent some
  years at an English University, or have been trained at the English Bar.
  Residence in England, and a close study of British politics make the
  educated Indian anxious for political rights in his own country, similar
  to those that are given to him in Great Britain. In England the Indian
  has all the political rights of a British subject. He can vote for a
  member of Parliament, he can even be a member of the House of Commons. On
  two occasions in recent years, an Indian has been elected to Parliament:
  Mr. Dadabhai Naoroji sat as Liberal M.P. for Finsbury, 1892-5; Sir M.M.
  Bhownagree as a Conservative for Bethnal Green, 1895-1906. Back in his
  native land, the Indian finds that he belongs to a subject race, and that
  the British garrison will neither admit him to social equality, nor
  permit him the right of legislation. Hence with eyes directed to Western
  forms of government, the Indian is discontented with the bureaucracy that
  rules his land, and disaffected from the Imperial power. But so many are
  the nations in India, and so poverty-stricken is the great multitude of
  its peasantry that the Nationalist movement can touch but the fringe of
  the population, and the millions of India live patiently and contentedly
  under the British Crown. Nevertheless, the national movement grows
  steadily in numbers and in influence, for it is difficult for those who,
  politically minded, have once known political freedom, to resign
  themselves to political subjection.</p>

  <p>In Egypt the Nationalist movement is naturally smaller and more
  concentrated than in India and the racial divisions hinder its unity.
  Egypt is nominally under the suzerainty of Turkey, though occupied by
  Great Britain, and now that Turkey has set up a Constitution and a
  Parliament, patriotic Egyptian politicians are impatient at the blocking
  out by the British authorities of every proposal for self-government.</p>

  <p>As in India, so in Egypt: it is the men of education who are
  responsible for the Nationalist movement. And in both countries it is the
  desire to experiment in representative government, to test the
  constitutional forms in common use in the West, and to practise the
  responsibilities of citizenship, that stimulates the movement. The
  unwillingness of the British Government to gratify this desire explains
  the hostility to British rule in India and Egypt.</p>

  <p>Japan received a Constitution from the Emperor in 1890, and in 1891
  its Diet was formally opened with great national enthusiasm. It is a
  two-chamber Parliament&mdash;a Council of nobles, and a popularly elected
  assembly&mdash;and only in the last few years have the business men given
  their attention to it. Although the Cabinet is influenced by Japanese
  public opinion, it is not directly responsible to the Diet, but is the
  Ministry of the Mikado. The resolution of the Japanese statesmen of forty
  years ago to make Japan a world-power made Constitutional Government, in
  their eyes, a necessity for the nation.</p>

  <p>In Europe, Norway, Sweden, and Denmark all possess democratic
  constitutions, and only the removal of sex disabilities in the latter two
  is needed to achieve complete adult suffrage. Finland established
  complete democracy nine years ago, and, with equal electoral districts,
  complete adult suffrage, and the free election of women equally with men
  to its Diet, is a model democratic state. But the liberties of Finland
  are gravely threatened by the Russian Government, and there is no
  security for the Finns that their excellent self-government will be
  preserved. In Germany, with universal manhood suffrage, the struggle is
  to make the Government responsible to the elected Reichstag.</p>

  <p>The British self-governing Colonies show a tendency of democracy to
  federate. The Australian Colonies are federated into a Commonwealth, and
  their example has been followed by the South African Colonies. New
  Zealand and Australia are at one in their franchise, which allows no
  barrier of sex; but South Africa still restricts the vote to males. In
  Australia the working class are in power, and the Commonwealth Prime
  Minister is a Labour representative. There is no willingness to grant
  political rights to those who are not of European race, either in South
  Africa or in Australia; and the universal republic dreamed of by
  eighteenth century democrats, a republic which should know no racial or
  "colour" bar, is not in the vision of the modern colonial statesmen of
  democracy, who are frankly exclusive. Only in New Zealand does a native
  race elect its own members to Parliament&mdash;and four Maori M.P.'s are
  returned.</p>

<h4><font class="sc">Tyranny under Democratic Forms</font></h4>

  <p>Experience has proved that democratic and republican forms of
  government are no guarantee that the nation possesses political
  liberty.</p>

  <p>Mexico, nominally a republic under President Diaz, was in reality a
  military autocracy of the severest kind. The South American Republics are
  merely unstable monarchies, at the mercy of men who can manipulate the
  political machinery and get control of the army.</p>

  <p>It is too early yet to decide whether the constitutional form of
  government set up in Turkey in 1908, or the republic created on the
  abolition of monarchy in Portugal in 1910, mark national movements to
  democracy. In neither country is there evidence that general political
  freedom has been the goal of the successful revolutionist, or that the
  people have obtained any considerable measure of political power or civil
  liberty. Ambitious and unscrupulous men can make full use of republican
  and democratic forms to gain political mastery over their less cunning
  fellows, and no machinery of government has ever yet been devised that
  will safeguard the weak and the foolish from the authority of the strong
  and the capable.</p>

  <p>Those who put their trust in theories of popular sovereignty, and urge
  the referendum and initiative as the surer instruments of democracy than
  Parliamentary representation, may recall that a popular plebiscite
  organised by Napoleon in 1802 conferred on him the Consulate for life;
  that Louis Napoleon was made President of the French Republic in 1848 by
  a popular vote, obtained a new constitution by a plebiscite in 1851, and
  a year later arranged another plebiscite which declared him hereditary
  Emperor, Napoleon III. France, where naturally Rousseau's theories have
  made the deepest impression, has since the Revolution gloried in the
  right of the "sovereign people" to overthrow the government, and its
  elected representatives have been alternately at the mercy of dictators
  and social revolutionists.</p>

  <p>On the whole, the stability of the British Government, rooted in the
  main on the traditional belief in the representation of the electorate,
  would seem to make more surely for national progress and wider political
  liberty than the alternation of revolution and reaction which France has
  known in the last hundred and twenty years.</p>

  <p>England has not been without its popular outbursts against what the
  American poet called "the never-ending audacity of elected persons," but
  these outbursts are commonly accepted as manifestations of intolerable
  conditions; and while the outbursts are repressed means are taken by
  Government to amend the conditions. When the Government fails to amend
  things, the House of Commons takes the matter up; and if the Commons
  neglect to do so, then the electors make it plain that amendment and
  reform are necessary by returning men to Parliament pledged to change
  matters, and by rejecting those who have failed to meet the
  situation.</p>

<h4><font class="sc">The Obvious Dangers</font></h4>

  <p>The dangers that threaten democracy are obvious. Universal adult
  suffrage, short Parliaments, proportional representation, equal electoral
  districts, second ballots&mdash;none of these things can insure democracy
  against corruption. For a government which rests on the will of a
  people&mdash;a will expressed by the election of representatives&mdash;is
  inevitably exposed to all the evils attendant on the unruly wills and
  affections of the average man.</p>

  <p>The orator can play upon the feelings of the crowd, and sway
  multitudes against a better judgment; and he has greater chance of
  working mischief when a referendum or other direct instrument of
  democracy is in vogue than he has when government is by elected
  representatives. For the party system, itself open to plenty of
  criticism, constantly defeats the orator by the superior power of
  organisation. Hence it frequently happens at Parliamentary elections that
  a candidate whose meetings are enthusiastic and well attended fails
  lamentably at the poll. His followers are a crowd; they are not a party.
  They do not know each other, and they have not the confidence that comes
  of membership in a large society.</p>

<h4><font class="sc">Party Government</font></h4>

  <p>If the orator is a menace to the wise decisions of the people by a
  referendum, the party organiser and political "boss" can easily be a
  curse to representative government on party lines. By all manner of
  unholy devices he can secure votes for his candidate and his party, and
  he has raised (or lowered) the simple business of getting the people to
  choose their representative into the art of electioneering. The triumph
  of political principles by the election of persons to carry out those
  principles becomes of less importance than the successful working of the
  party machine, when the boss and the organiser are conspicuous. Patronage
  becomes the method for keeping the party in power, and the promise of
  rewards and spoils enables an opposition to defeat the Government and
  obtain office. To be outside the party is to lose all chance of sharing
  in the spoils, and to take an interest in politics means, under these
  circumstances, to expect some consideration in the distribution of
  honours.</p>

  <p>The "spoils system" is notorious in America, but in England it has
  become practically impossible for a man to take any serious part in
  politics except by becoming part of the machine. An independent attitude
  means isolation. To belong to a party&mdash;Liberal, Unionist, or
  Labour&mdash;and to criticise its policy, or differ from its leaders, is
  resented as impertinence. The machine is master of the man. A troublesome
  and dangerous critic is commonly bought or silenced. He is given office
  in the Government, or rewarded with a legal appointment; perhaps made a
  peer if his tastes are in that direction. A critic who cannot command a
  considerable backing among the electorate will probably be driven out of
  public life. The disinterested activity in politics that puts the
  commonwealth before party gain is naturally discouraged by the party
  organisers.</p>

  <p>Yet when public interest in national affairs sinks to the merely
  sporting instinct of "backing your candidate" at elections as a horse is
  backed at race meetings, and of "shouting for your party" as men shout
  for their favourite football team, or sinks still lower to the mercenary
  speculation of personal gain or loss on election results, then another
  danger comes in&mdash;the indifference of the average honest citizen to
  all politics, and the cynical disbelief in political honesty.</p>

  <p>The warnings of John Stuart Mill against leaving politics to the
  politicians and against the professional position may be quoted:</p>

  <p>"Representative institutions are of little value, and may be a mere
  instrument of tyranny or intrigue when the generality of electors are not
  sufficiently interested in their own government to give their vote; or,
  if they vote at all, do not bestow their suffrages on public grounds, but
  sell them for money, or vote at the beck of some one who has control over
  them, or whom for private reasons they desire to propitiate. Popular
  elections as thus practised, instead of a security against misgovernment,
  are but an additional wheel in its machinery."</p>

  <p>Mill himself was a striking example of the entirely disinterested
  politician, who, caring a great deal more for principles than for party,
  finds little favour with the electors, and less with the party managers,
  and retires from politics to the relief of his fellows.</p>

  <p>A general lack of interest in politics can prove fatal to democracy.
  The party managers, without the fear of the electorate before their eyes,
  will increase the number of salaried officials and strengthen their
  position by judicious appointments. Nominally, these inspectors and
  officers will be required for the public service, and the appointments
  will be justified on patriotic grounds. There will be little criticism in
  Parliament, because the party not in power will be anxious to create
  similar "jobs" when its own turn comes. Besides, as the public pays for
  these officials, there is no drain on the party funds; and this is a
  matter of congratulation to party managers, who are always anxious not to
  spend more than they can help on the political machinery.</p>

<h4><font class="sc">Bureaucracy</font></h4>

  <p>But the horde of officials and inspectors will change democracy into
  bureaucracy, and the discovery is sometimes made too late that a land is
  ruled by permanent officials, and not by elected representatives. The
  elected representatives may sit and pass laws, but the bureaucracy which
  administers them will be the real authority.</p>

  <p>It may be an entirely honest and efficient bureaucracy, as free from
  political partisanship as our British Civil Service and police-court
  magistracy are, but if it is admitted to be outside the jurisdiction of
  the House of Commons, and to be under no obedience to local councils, and
  if its powers involve a close inquisition into the lives of the people,
  and include the right to interfere daily with these lives, then
  bureaucracy and not democracy is the actual government.</p>

  <p>A host of salaried political workers&mdash;agents, organisers,
  secretaries, etc.&mdash;will make popular representative government a
  mere matter of political rivalry, an affair of "ins and outs," and by
  this development of the party system will exclude from active politics
  all who are not loyal to the "machine," and are not strong enough to
  break it. But a host of public officers&mdash;inspectors, clerks,
  etc.&mdash;paid out of the public funds will do more than pervert
  representative government: they will make it subordinate to the permanent
  official class; and bureaucracy, once firmly in the saddle, is harder to
  get rid of than the absolutism of kings, or the rule of an
  aristocracy.</p>

  <p>Yet a permanent Civil Service is better in every way in a democracy
  than a Civil Service which lives and dies with a political party, and is
  changed with the Cabinet.</p>

  <p>On the whole, the best thing for democracy is that the paid workers in
  politics should be as few as possible, and the number of salaried state
  officials strictly limited. The fewer the paid political workers, the
  fewer people will be concerned to maintain the efficiency of the
  political machine, and the more freely will the electorate act in the
  choice of its representatives. The fewer the salaried officials of State,
  the less inspection and restriction, and the less encouragement to habits
  of submission in the people. Democracy must depend on a healthy, robust
  sense of personal responsibility in its citizens, and every increase in
  the inspectorate tends to diminish this personal responsibility, and to
  breed a "servile state" that will fall a willing prey to tyranny and
  bureaucracy.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, whilst in self-defence democracy will avoid increasing
  its officials, it will distinguish between officials and employees. It is
  bound to add to the number of its employees every year, as its municipal
  and imperial responsibilities grow steadily larger, and these employees,
  rightly regarded as public servants, cannot threaten to become our
  masters.</p>

<h4><font class="sc">Working-Class Ascendancy</font></h4>

  <p>Still one more danger to democracy may be mentioned, and that is the
  notion that from the working class must necessarily come our best
  rulers.</p>

  <p>"Rulers are not wise by reason of their number or their poverty, or
  their reception of a weekly wage instead of a monthly salary or yearly
  income. It is worse and more unpleasant and more dangerous to be ruled by
  many fools than by one fool, or a few fools. The tyranny of an ignorant
  and cowardly mob is a worse tyranny than the tyranny of an ignorant and
  cowardly clique or individual.</p>

  <p>"Workers are not respectable or to be considered because they work
  more with their hands or feet than with their brains, but because the
  work they do is good. If it is not good work they do, they are as
  unprofitable as any other wasters. A plumber is not a useful or admirable
  creature because he plumbs (if he plumbs ignorantly or dishonestly, he is
  often either a manslayer or a murderer), but because he plumbs well, and
  saves the community from danger and damp, disease, and fire and water.
  Makers of useless machine-made ornaments are, however 'horny-handed,'
  really 'anti-social persons,' baneful to the community as far as their
  bad work goes; more baneful, possibly, than the consumers of these bad
  articles, quite as baneful as the <i>entrepreneurs</i> who employ
  them.</p>

  <p>"The only good institutions are those that do good work; the only good
  work done is that which produces good results, whether they be direct, as
  the plough-man's, or navvy's, or sailor's; or indirect, as the policeman,
  or the schoolmaster, or the teacher of good art, or the writer of books
  that are worth reading. A man is no better or wiser than others by reason
  of his position or lack of position, but by reason of his stronger body,
  wiser head, better skill, greater endurance, keener courage."<a
  name="footnotetag89" href="#footnote89"><sup>[89]</sup></a></p>

  <p>There it is. Democracy needs for its counsellors, legislators and
  ministers, strength, wisdom, skill, endurance and courage, and must get
  these qualities in whomsoever they are to be found. Democracy can afford
  the widest range of choice in the election of popular representatives, or
  it will never reach its full stature.</p>

  <p>In the choice of its representatives, a democracy will do well to
  elect those who know the life of the working people, and who share its
  toils; just as it will do well to shun the mere talker, and to seek out
  for itself candidates for election rather than have candidates thrust
  upon its attention by some caucus in London. But the main thing is that
  it should first discern men and women of ability and of character and
  then elect them for its representatives, rejecting those, it may be of
  more dazzling qualities, who are unstable in mind and consumed with
  vanity. It would be well if the elected representative were always an
  inhabitant of the county or the borough, known to his neighbours, and of
  tested worth. True, the prophet is often without honour in his own
  country, and a constituency acts wisely in electing a representative of
  national repute. But to search for a man of wealth who will subsidise
  every club and charitable institution in the constituency, and to rejoice
  when such a candidate is procured from some political headquarters, is a
  wretched proceeding in a democratic state. The member who buys a
  constituency by his gifts will always feel entitled to sell his
  constituents should occasion arise.</p>

  <p>Again, the delegate theory of representation can be a danger to
  democracy.</p>

  <p>A Parliamentary representative is something better than a mechanical
  contrivance for registering the opinions of electors on certain subjects.
  Otherwise all Parliamentary debate is a mockery. A representative he is
  of the majority of electors, but he must act freely and with initiative.
  Often enough he may be constrained to vote, not as many of his
  constituents would prefer, but using his own judgment. Of course when the
  choice is between obedience to the party whip and the wishes of his
  constituents, and personal conviction is with the latter, then at all
  costs the decision should be to stand by his constituents, or popular
  representation is a delusion.</p>

  <p>To-day the pressure is far greater from the party whips than from the
  constituents, especially when in so many cases election expenses are
  paid, in part at least, from the party funds. And to overcome this
  constant danger to popular representation a sure plan would be the
  payment of all necessary election expenses out of the local rates, and
  the prohibition by law of all payments by the candidate or by political
  associations. When members are paid for their attendance in Parliament,
  far better would it be, too, if such payment were made by the
  constituents in each case, and not from the national exchequer.<a
  name="footnotetag90" href="#footnote90"><sup>[90]</sup></a> Worse than
  the delegate theory is the opinion that a representative of the people is
  in Parliament chiefly to keep his party in power. Political parties are
  inevitable, and they are effective and convenient when principles divide
  people. But popular representation is older than a party system of
  government, and when it becomes utterly subordinate to the welfare of
  parties it is time for a democratic people to realise the possible loss
  of their instrument of liberty.</p>

  <p>Great Britain is not partial to groups, it has always broadly been
  divided politically into two camps, but a few men of strong independent
  judgment are invaluable in a popular assembly. There need be no fear lest
  governments totter and fall at the presence of men who dare to take a
  line of their own, and to speak out boldly on occasion. The bulk of
  members of Parliament will always cleave to their party, as the bulk of
  electors do, and the dread of being thought singular is a potent
  influence on the average man, in or out of Parliament. Democracy is in
  danger of losing the counsel of its best men when it insists that its
  representatives must be merely delegates of the electors, without minds
  or wills of their own; but it is in greater danger if it allows its
  representatives to be nothing but the tools of the party in power or in
  opposition. For when Parliamentary representation is confined to those
  who are willing to be the mechanical implements of party leaders and
  managers, the House of Commons becomes an assembly of place-hunters and
  self-seekers, for whom the profession of politics affords the
  gratification of vanity or enrichment at the public expense. In such an
  assembly the self-respecting man with a laudable willingness to serve the
  State is conspicuous by his absence.</p>

  <p>With a Press in the hands of party politicians, and with editors and
  journalists engaged to write up their party through thick and thin, and
  to write down every honest effort at political independence of mind, the
  danger of losing from all political service the few rare minds that can
  ill be spared is a very real and present danger.</p>

<h4><font class="sc">On Behalf of Democracy</font></h4>

  <p>"The price of liberty is eternal vigilance," and often enough we sleep
  at our vigils. But when all the dangers and difficulties that beset
  democracy are enumerated, and all its weak spots are laid bare, we can
  still hold democracy to be the only suitable form of government for
  persons possessing free will, and the representation of the people the
  most satisfactory expression of democracy.</p>

  <p>Government by autocrat, by despotism, benevolent or otherwise, by
  expert officials, or by an oligarchy of superior intelligences is irksome
  to the average man or woman of reasonable education, and in each case has
  been intolerable to the British people. They have all been tried and
  found wanting&mdash;royal absolutism, aristocracy, military dictatorship,
  and only of late have we been threatened by an expert bureaucracy.</p>

  <p>Parliamentary representation adapted, by the removal of disabilities
  of creed and rank and income, to meet the demands of the nation, has been
  proved by experience a clumsy but useful weapon for checking oppression.
  Nowadays, we are using it less for defence against oppression, or as an
  instrument for removing political grievances, and are testing its worth
  for the provision of positive social reform. More and more it is required
  of Parliament that means be found for getting rid of the ills around us,
  for preventing disease and destitution, for promoting health and
  decency.</p>

  <p>And just because legislation is, at the prompting of a social
  conscience, invading our homes and workshops, penetrating into prisons,
  workhouses, and hospitals, touching the lives of all of us from the
  cradle to the grave, the more imperative is it that our legislators
  should be chosen freely by the widest electorate of men and women. We
  fall back on the old maxim: "That which touches all shall be approved by
  all," and can perceive no other way of obtaining that general approbation
  for the laws than by the popular election of our representatives.</p>

  <p>Demagogues may exploit the popular will, the cunning and unscrupulous
  in power may have us at their mercy, in our folly and indifference the
  nation may be brought to grave losses; but still there is always the
  means of recovery for the well-disposed while the vote remains in their
  hands.</p>

  <p>So it is that, in spite of obvious failings and shortcomings,
  democracy by representative government remains for nations throughout the
  world that have not yet tried it the goal of their political striving. We
  are alive to the imperfections of democracy. It is no automatic machine
  for conferring benefits in return for taxes. It is the creation of
  mankind, not a revelation from heaven; and it needs, like all good human
  things, constant attention and can bear many improvements. It has to be
  adjusted from time to time to suit the growing capacities of
  mankind&mdash;as the popular assembly gave way to the representative
  assembly&mdash;and only on the failure to make the adjustment does it get
  rusty and out of order. It has to meet the requirements of vast empires
  and mighty confederations of states, and to fulfil the wants of small
  republics and parish councils.</p>

  <p>What but democracy can answer to the call for political liberty that
  sounds from so many lands and in so many varying tongues? Did any other
  form of government devised by the wit of man make such universal
  appeal?</p>

  <p>And when all is said and done&mdash;what does this democracy, this
  government by popular representatives, mean, but government by the
  consent of the governed&mdash;the only form of government tolerable to
  civilised mankind in the twentieth century?</p>

  <p>Given a fairly good standard of common honesty in the ordinary
  dealings of life, and the honesty of our public life, whether in
  Parliament or in the Civil Service, in executive or administration, will
  serve. If the private and commercial life is corroded with dishonesty,
  then democracy will be bitten by knaves and rascals. For our chosen
  rulers have a way of faithfully reflecting the morality of their
  electors, and are not free to indulge their fancies, as kings of old
  were.</p>

  <p>Politics are not, and never will be, or ought to be, the chief
  interest and concern of the mass of people in a healthy community where
  slavery is extinct. And democracy makes no demand that would involve such
  interest and concern. The choice of honest representatives, persons of
  goodwill, and reasonable intelligence, is no tremendous task in a
  community where honesty, goodwill, and intelligence prevail. And if these
  things do not prevail, if honesty is contemned in business, and goodwill
  between man and man despised, and intelligence frowned upon, then it is
  of small importance what the government of such a nation is, for that
  nation is doomed, and it is well for the world that it should be
  doomed.</p>

  <p>But, on the whole, it seems indisputable that the common people of the
  great nations do cleave to honesty and goodwill, and that the desire for
  intelligence is being widely fostered. As long, then, as we can count on
  honesty, goodwill, and intelligence in our streets and market-places, as
  we can to-day, mankind does well to elect its representatives to council
  and Parliament and proclaim democracy&mdash;"Government of the people, by
  the people, for the people"&mdash;as the proper government for
  mankind.</p>

  regretted that the cost has not been laid directly on the electors, and
  that the time is not more appropriate. With the country torn with strikes
  of workmen seeking a few extra shillings a week, it was hardly the
  opportune moment for a House of Commons to vote itself some £250,000 a
  year. The proposal would have been more palatable to the nation if the
  Commons had decided that payment should begin with the <i>next</i>

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
